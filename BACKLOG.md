# Backlog

Personal backlog for `rykerwilliams/phase`. Lives only on this fork's `main` —
it is a divergent file and must never appear in a PR to `phase-rs/phase`.
Every feature/fix branch is cut fresh from `origin/main` (upstream), never
from this fork's `main`, so this file is automatically excluded from PR
diffs — no extra tooling required.

## Format

Each item is written so it can be pasted with little or no editing as the
opening instruction to the next pipeline step (usually `/engine-implementer`
for a bug fix, or a plain investigation prompt for research/infra work).

- **Title**
- **Type** — `bug-fix` | `feature` | `infra` | `research`
- **Status** — `open` | `in-progress` | `done`
- **Source** — where this came from
- **Prompt** — ready-to-paste instruction for the next agent/skill invocation

Move an item to the bottom "Done" section (don't delete it) once it ships,
so there's a record of what's already been resolved.

## Open

### [infra] Host my fork of phase.rs at phase.teamserio.us

- **Status:** open
- **Source:** 2026-07-06 planning discussion
- **Context (verified, not assumed):**
  - Target: run my fork at `phase.teamserio.us`, on the same AWS host that
    already serves `teamserio.us` and other sites behind a single **nginx**
    reverse proxy.
  - nginx config lives **only on the host** (SSH-edited, not tracked in any
    repo) — no config-as-code to read/PR against; changes have to be made
    live over SSH and `nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx` (or equivalent).
  - Known-working deploy pattern, copied from `teamserio.us`
    (`/mnt/c/git/teamserio.us/.github/workflows/jekyll-build-and-deploy-prod.yml`):
    GitHub Actions builds the static site, then `appleboy/ssh-action` wipes
    the target directory and `appleboy/scp-action` copies the fresh build
    over SSH to a directory on the host (teamserio.us uses `/prod-www/`).
    Secrets: `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USERNAME`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`,
    `DEPLOY_HOST_PORT`. Phase.rs's client build is a static bundle too
    (`pnpm build` in `client/`), so the same SSH/SCP pattern applies
    directly — just to a new directory (e.g. `/phase-www/`) and a new
    nginx server block for `phase.teamserio.us`.
  - Unlike the Jekyll blog, phase.rs also needs a **running backend**:
    `phase-server` (WebSocket, `/ws`, plus `/health`) per README's
    "Dedicated Server" Docker instructions. That needs to run persistently
    on the same host (`docker run -d --restart unless-stopped`, bound to
    `127.0.0.1:9374` per README's own guidance for the reverse-proxy case),
    with nginx adding a `location /ws { proxy_pass ...; proxy_set_header
    Upgrade ...; }` block for `phase.teamserio.us` alongside the static
    file block.
  - Card data must be generated **from this fork**
    (`scripts/gen-card-data.sh`), not pulled from upstream's published
    data, or fork-only fixes (e.g. Hollow One) silently won't show up in
    play. The upstream `phase-server` Docker image
    (`ghcr.io/phase-rs/phase-server`) is built from upstream too — the
    fork needs its own image (root `Dockerfile`) built and either pushed
    to `ghcr.io/rykerwilliams/phase-server` or built directly on the host.
  - TLS for the new subdomain: unconfirmed whether the host already uses
    certbot/Let's Encrypt for its other sites — check on the host before
    assuming a mechanism.
  - Project is a **non-commercial fan project** under the WotC Fan Content
    Policy — hosting must stay within that (no monetization, etc.).
- **Prompt:**
  > Produce a concrete, step-by-step plan to host my phase.rs fork
  > (`rykerwilliams/phase`) at `phase.teamserio.us`, on the same AWS host
  > that already serves teamserio.us behind nginx (config is host-only,
  > SSH-edited, not in any repo). Mirror teamserio.us's own deploy pattern
  > (`.github/workflows/jekyll-build-and-deploy-prod.yml` in
  > `/mnt/c/git/teamserio.us`) for the static client: GitHub Actions builds
  > `client/` with `pnpm build` against card data generated from *this
  > fork* (not upstream's), then `appleboy/ssh-action` + `scp-action` ships
  > it to a new directory on the host (e.g. `/phase-www/`). Additionally
  > plan: (1) the phase-server Docker container running persistently on
  > the host bound to localhost only, built from the fork's own
  > `Dockerfile`; (2) the exact nginx server block for
  > `phase.teamserio.us` — static file serving plus a `/ws` WebSocket
  > proxy to phase-server, and how it should get a TLS cert (check what
  > the host already uses for its other sites before assuming certbot);
  > (3) whether GitHub Actions should also build+push the fork's
  > `phase-server` image, or whether it's simpler to `git pull` + rebuild
  > directly on the host when the fork's engine changes. Confirm the nginx
  > software/config approach and get my explicit go-ahead on the exact SSH
  > commands and nginx block before touching the live host — it's serving
  > my real blog and other sites, so nothing here should run unattended.

### [feature] Configurable, non-copyrighted card back art

- **Status:** open
- **Source:** 2026-07-06 planning discussion
- **Context (verified against the repo, not assumed):**
  - Card back art is currently hardcoded: `CARD_BACK_URL` in
    `client/src/services/scryfall.ts:33-34`, hotlinked from Scryfall's
    generic-back CDN asset, deliberately non-configurable to avoid bundling
    WotC-copyrighted art. No config/env override exists today.
  - There's an almost-exact architectural precedent already upstream to
    mirror: **board background** is a real, pluggable preference —
    `boardBackground` (`"auto-wubrg" | "random" | "none" | "custom" |
    string`) plus `customBackgroundUrl` in the preferences store, resolved
    in `client/src/components/board/BattlefieldBackground.tsx:20-54`
    (curated art, plain colors, deck-color auto-match, or a user-supplied
    custom image URL), surfaced in `PreferencesModal.tsx:97-106+` and
    `BoardContextMenu.tsx:71`.
  - The audio theme system (`client/src/audio/themeRegistry.ts`) is a
    second precedent for "load user-supplied asset by URL, validate,
    cache" if a richer manifest (e.g. a full back-art *set* rather than one
    URL) ends up being wanted instead of a single image URL.
  - This is generically useful (not fork-specific) and follows an existing,
    already-accepted pattern closely enough that it's a real candidate for
    an upstream PR to `phase-rs/phase`, not just a personal fork
    customization — worth floating to the maintainer/Discord before
    building, in case there's already a reason it wasn't done (e.g. a
    licensing concern specific to *any* non-default back art, even
    non-copyrighted).
- **Prompt:**
  > Add a configurable card-back-art preference to phase.rs, mirroring the
  > existing `boardBackground`/`customBackgroundUrl` pattern
  > (`client/src/components/board/BattlefieldBackground.tsx`,
  > preferences store). Default stays the current hardcoded Scryfall
  > generic back (`client/src/services/scryfall.ts` `CARD_BACK_URL`) so
  > behavior is unchanged out of the box; add a preference (e.g.
  > `cardBackUrl: "default" | string`) that lets a user supply their own
  > non-copyrighted image URL, surfaced in the same preferences modal /
  > context-menu pattern board background uses. This is a frontend-only,
  > display-layer change per CLAUDE.md's engine/frontend split — no engine
  > involvement expected. Use the `/add-frontend-component` skill for the
  > UI piece. Before implementing, check whether this is better proposed
  > upstream to `phase-rs/phase` (it mirrors an already-accepted pattern
  > and isn't fork-specific) rather than kept as a fork-only customization
  > — flag that choice back to me rather than assuming either way.
