/**
 * `AttachmentFan` mode 2 — the fan as a reachability surface for an attached
 * permanent's OWN legal actions (plan §6.9). Rows V1–V12.
 *
 * Membership is NOT tested here beyond "the fan renders exactly what the engine
 * published", because it is no longer this component's decision:
 * `crates/engine/tests/integration/interaction_contract.rs` owns the subtree
 * walk, its order and its both-direction validation.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS MODULE COVERS: with Kilo (401) enchanted by Freed from the Real
 * (408), the engine published `legalActionsByObject["408"] = [#0, #1]` and the
 * fan was inert — no ring, and clicking Freed did nothing. Before this change
 * the fan had exactly one source (an open interaction's projection), so a
 * populated bucket with no prompt open reached nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVIDENCE-LABEL CONVENTION (plan §7.2, binding on this module).
 * Every comment in this file that carries a mutant/coverage claim is tagged,
 * and the tag says what KIND of statement it is — an in-file label is
 * otherwise ambiguous between an instruction and a report:
 *
 *   MEASURED   a PAST-TENSE REPORT: this PR ran that arm and the quoted line
 *              is the failing assertion it produced.
 *   QUOTED     a past-tense report copied verbatim from a named harness log.
 *   POINTER    names a sweep row / mutant id whose measurement lives in the
 *              plan's evidence logs, not here.
 *   PAIR-ONLY / DROP-ONLY   the row carries ONE side by construction (§7.1)
 *              and is counted as coverage for that side only.
 *
 * An untagged comment is prose and is evidence for nothing.
 *
 * NAMED UNMEASURED ANCHOR IN THIS FILE: none. Every row below carries at least
 * one measured side; the rows that carry only one are labelled above.
