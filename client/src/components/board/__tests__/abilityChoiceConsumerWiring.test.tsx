/**
 * Plan row V25 — THE USER'S BUG, END TO END, THROUGH A REAL CONSUMER.
 *
 * Every other row in this matrix asserts "opens the modal" on the store,
 * because `AbilityChoiceModal` is module-private inside `GamePage.tsx:3074`.
 * `pendingAbilityChoice` IS that modal's input contract, and `DialogHost`
 * (`:118-120` sets `hasUiDialog` from it, `:131-132` turns that into
 * `dialogVisible`, `:199` anchors `fixed inset-0 z-40`) is the consumer that
 * decides whether anything is painted at all. This row drives the PRODUCER
 * (`AttachmentFan` mode 2) and observes the real CONSUMER, so the wiring
 * between them is measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVIDENCE-LABEL CONVENTION (plan §7.2, binding on this module):
 *   MEASURED  a PAST-TENSE REPORT — this PR ran that mutant arm and the quoted
 *             line is the assertion that flipped.
 *   QUOTED    a past-tense report copied verbatim from a named plan log.
 * An untagged comment is prose and is evidence for nothing.
 *
 * ASSERTION ORDER: none. Both observations use `expect.soft`, so neither can
 * pre-empt the other. That is not a style choice — with hard asserts the
 * payload assert throws first on BOTH mutant arms and the overlay assert (the
 * only assertion in this matrix that observes a `pendingAbilityChoice`
 * CONSUMER) is never reached, i.e. unmeasured.
 * QUOTED (`.plan3r10-v25soft.log`, the three trees the applier built out of §6):
 *   `R10V25[BASE]      FAILINGASSERT| ASSERT=overlay: expected +0 to be 1`
 *   `R10V25[BASE]      FAILINGASSERT| ASSERT=payload: expected null to deeply equal { objectId: 408, actions: [ …(2) `
 *   `R10V25[ADOPTED]   CARDINALITY|      Tests  3 passed (3)`
 *   `R10V25[ALWAYSMUT] FAILINGASSERT| ASSERT=overlay: expected 1 to be +0`
 *   `R10V25[ALWAYSMUT] FAILINGASSERT| ASSERT=payload: expected { objectId: 401, actions: [ …(2)`
 *
 * NAMED UNMEASURED ANCHOR: the `GamePage.tsx:3122` options map. It is the other
 * consumer of `pendingAbilityChoice` and this module does NOT observe it — plan
 * §7.3 row V26 registers it as an audited absence. It is coverage for nothing.
