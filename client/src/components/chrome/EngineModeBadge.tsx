 * Only a null reason means the game never asked for the native engine (draft
 * matches, a chosen first player, resuming a WASM save); claiming the engine
 * is unavailable there would be false on a machine whose native engine works
 * fine. Every non-null reason is a failed attempt, so an unrecognized one must
 * still read as unavailable — a future reason silently downgraded to "never
 * asked" would be the same false claim in the opposite direction.
