  // uses aria-valuenow, and the three controls this box replaced announced their value NATIVELY
  // (`type="range"` ⇒ role slider, `type="number"` ⇒ role spinbutton). Dropping to a bare
  // `type="text"` therefore made the ACCEPTED amount inaudible — pressing +/− or the arrow keys
  // mutated a value nothing exposed. The role is descriptive rather than decorative because the
  // box implements the pattern's CORE keyboard interaction (ArrowUp/ArrowDown step, clamped to
  // the window) — not the full APG list. Home/End (jump to min/max) are deliberately NOT
  // remapped: the host is a real editable text field where they carry load-bearing caret
  // semantics, and native `<input type="number">` — whose implicit role is already spinbutton —
  // does not remap them either.
  // `aria-valuenow` uses the VALIDATED amount, so it is absent while the entry is out of range
  // rather than contradicting aria-valuemin/max; `aria-invalid` carries that state instead.

          `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` are resolved by a screen reader when focus ARRIVES at

          announces nothing: the player would have to tab away and back to learn the entry was
