  // Card-relative sizing in container-query inline units (1cqi = 1% of the
  // nearest `@container` ancestor's width). Consumers that pass `size="fluid"`
  // MUST wrap the pips in an element with `container-type: inline-size` sized to
  // the card (e.g. an `absolute inset-0 @container` overlay); the badge then
  // anchors itself over the printed cost via FLUID_ANCHOR.
  //
  // The badge stands in for the card's PRINTED mana cost (it shows the engine's
  // effective cost), so its geometry is calibrated against that cost rather than
  // against any fixed px size. Measured on M15-frame art, a printed symbol is
  // ~5.2% of the card's width, so the 0.4cqi padding sizes the symbol to exactly
  // that and the 6cqi disk reads as a thin ring around it. The printed symbols
  // on the same card are legible at this size, which is what makes it enough.
  //
  // Keep the three values solving 5*container + 4*gap = 32cqi: that is the
  // widest cost the frame carries (five symbols), and 32cqi is what clears the
  // card name instead of running through it.

// Where the printed cost sits on an M15 frame: right edge ~7% in from the card's
// right edge, top edge ~5.4% down from its top. Owning this here keeps the
// anchor in lockstep with the pip diameter above — the two only look right
// together, and every card overlay wants the same placement.
