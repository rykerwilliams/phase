/**
 * Regression test for the pod-draft guest's collapsed seat.
 *
 * `usePlayerId`/`getPlayerId` are the single authority for "which seat is this
 * client's own" — 54 production call sites read one of them, from the mulligan
 * modal's `pending.find` in `GamePage` to `gameLoopController`'s priority gate
 * and `useConcedeHandler`'s `player_id`. Both resolved the answer from a
 * hand-typed list of game modes that predates `"draft-match"`, so a pod-draft
 * guest — correctly told `activePlayerId: 1` by `setupDraftMatchAvatars`
 * (`GameProvider.tsx`) — was answered seat 0, the host's seat.
 *
 * The class guard below is the one that would have caught it: for EVERY mode
 * that seats other humans, a client told "you are seat 1" must not answer 0.
 * It reads the mode census (`GAME_MODE_TRAITS`) rather than a second hand-typed
 * list, so a mode added later is covered on the day it is added.
 *
 * What these rows do NOT prove: they do not render `GamePage`, so they do not
 * show the mulligan modal appearing for the guest. They pin the seat authority
 * that modal's `pending.find(e => e.player === playerId)` reads.
