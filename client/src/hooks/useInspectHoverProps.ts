/**
 * Returns a hover-props factory for list-render sites where useCardHover cannot
 * be called per-item (cards rendered in a `.map()`).
 *
 * Both gestures are always wired, each gated on the event's own `pointerType`:
 * hover preview for anything that isn't a finger, long-press → sticky preview
 * for fingers. Gating per-event instead of on a device-capability media query
 * is what makes this work on hosts that misreport their input — a remote-desktop
 * session advertises no hover-capable input while still sending
 * `pointerType: "mouse"`. See useCardHover, which splits the same way.
 *
 * The touch-synthesized enter stays suppressed: it would open the
 * dismiss-looping MobilePreviewOverlay and block card selection.
 *
 * Because hooks can't run per-item, a single shared long-press timer serves the
 * whole list: only one pointer is active at a time, so each card's onPointerDown
 * records its id in pressedIdRef and the timer reads it when it fires. The click
 * a browser synthesizes after a long press is
 * swallowed in the CAPTURE phase (which runs before the caller's bubble-phase
 * onClick), so the preview gesture never also toggles selection — callers keep a
 * plain onClick and need no firedRef plumbing.
 *
 *   const hoverProps = useInspectHoverProps();
 *   <button {...hoverProps(id)} onClick={() => select(id)} />
 *
 * For per-card components (where useCardHover is callable), prefer useCardHover.
