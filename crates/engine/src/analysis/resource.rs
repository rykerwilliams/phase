//! `ResourceVector`: the monotone resource axes a net-progress loop can pump,
//! plus the resource-projected loop equality that distinguishes a beneficial
//! (CR 732.2) loop from a mandatory-draw (CR 104.4b / CR 732.4) loop.
//!
//! # Why a *separate* comparison from `loop_states_equal`
//!
//! CR 104.4b: a loop of *mandatory* actions that repeats a sequence "with no way
//! to stop" is a draw. The engine's existing `loop_states_equal` answers exactly
//! that question: it treats two states as the same loop point only when life,
//! damage, counters, and mana also match — because a mandatory loop that keeps
//! changing those values is not truly repeating and is *not* a draw.
//!
//! CR 732.2a: a player may instead take a *shortcut* through a loop "that repeats
//! a specified number of times". This is how a *beneficial* loop terminates: it
//! makes net progress on some resource each cycle (deal 1 more damage, add 1 more
//! mana, mill 1 more card), so the board returns to an identical configuration
//! while a resource counter strictly increases. Detecting that requires the
//! **complement** of `loop_states_equal`: board/zones/tap-state identical, but the
//! monotone resources allowed to differ.
//!
//! [`ResourceVector`] is the typed catalogue of those monotone axes;
//! [`loop_states_equal_modulo_resources`] is the projected comparison.

    // spellings and (a) holds for both: `TargetPin::Player` is the CR 115.10a CHOICE class,
    // while a CR 601.2c TARGET-class seat is
    // `Scheduled(TargetSchedule::Constant(Ranking::one(AnnouncementSubject::Seat(..))))` —
    // one entry, selected without reading the iteration index, so it too can never denote
    // "the newest copy". The split changes WHICH AUTHORITY judges a seat's legality, never
    // whether the designation is state-independent, which is all this precondition asks.
    // (This module reads no pin VARIANT at all — every `TargetPin::` occurrence in it is
    // prose — so no relief verdict can move with the spelling.) Precondition (c) is NOT taken on
    // trust from the mint site: [`pinned_may_choice_relief`] re-runs the mint's own
    // per-entry acceptance test — controller conjunct included — for THIS entry, so the
    // relief predicate is the mint predicate rather than a coarser sibling of it.
    // Precondition (b) is why relief is not a `continue`: the entry's RESIDUAL verdict
    // (its classification with the published CR 603.5 gate discharged) re-enters the same
    // gating an unpinned entry gets, so `FreeUnlessReplacements` still arms the

///
/// NOT A VISITOR, deliberately (#4603 error direction): an INCOMPLETE `QuantityRef`
/// collector is unsound HERE, because "every collected read excludes" is vacuously true
/// over a set that missed one. Instead, FOUR fail-closed conjuncts, each of which keeps
/// the conservative veto whenever it cannot prove its half:
///   (0) NO ACTIVATION RESTRICTIONS on this def: `exec.activation_restrictions.is_empty()`.
///       LOAD-BEARING, and conjunct (a) does NOT cover it — `ability_definition_axes`
///       destructures `activation_restrictions: _` (ability_scan.rs:4238), so the scan is
///       BLIND to it and the clone-and-rescan would return `false` even with a
///       class-MATCHING `ActivationRestriction::RequiresCondition` on the same def.
///       Measured cost: ZERO — no trigger `execute` in the card pool carries any
///       (positive control: 3195 on `abilities`).
///   (a) SOLE-SOURCE by single-field clone-and-rescan: clone the def, set
///       `condition = None`, and re-run `ability_definition_reads_sibling_mutable_for_loop`.
///       Only if THAT is `false` is `condition` the def's only sibling read — so no effect
///       body, cost, sub-ability or other field hides a second read this predicate never
///       looked at.
