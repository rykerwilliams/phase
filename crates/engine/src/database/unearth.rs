//! Unearth (CR 702.84) — graveyard-activated temporary reanimation keyword.
//!
//! CR 702.84a: "Unearth [cost]" means "[Cost]: Return this card from your
//! graveyard to the battlefield. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of
//! the next end step. If it would leave the battlefield, exile it instead of
//! putting it anywhere else. Activate only as a sorcery."
//!
//! Like Embalm / Eternalize (`database/embalm_eternalize.rs`), Unearth is an
//! activated ability that functions only while the card is in a graveyard, so
//! the synthesized ability carries `activation_zone = Some(Zone::Graveyard)` and
//! `sorcery_speed()`. Unlike those keywords it returns the *actual card* (not a
//! token copy), so the resolution is a four-part chain built entirely from
//! existing engine building blocks — this module adds **no new resolver**:
//!
//! 1. `Effect::ChangeZone` graveyard → battlefield (the reanimation itself),
//! 2. an `Effect::GenericEffect` continuous "gains haste" grant (Layer 6),
//! 3. an `Effect::CreateDelayedTrigger` that exiles the card at the next end
//!    step (CR 702.84a), and
//! 4. an `Effect::AddTargetReplacement` installing the "if it would leave the
//!    battlefield, exile it instead" replacement (CR 702.84a / CR 614.1a /
//!    CR 400.7), stamped `RestrictionExpiry::UntilHostLeavesPlay` so it is
//!    base-installed (surviving CR 613.1 layer reseeds), non-copiable
//!    (CR 707.2), and pruned when the host leaves the battlefield.
//!
//! Steps 2–4 are chained as `sub_ability` continuation steps (CR 608.2c) of the
//! primary `ChangeZone`, so they resolve as one action.
//!
//! Self-reference binding: every step targets `TargetFilter::SelfRef`. The card
//! keeps its `ObjectId` across the graveyard → battlefield move (`ObjectId` is
//! storage identity in `game/zones.rs::move_to_zone`, persistent across the
//! CR 400.7 "new object" boundary), so `SelfRef` — which resolves to the
//! ability's `source_id` — keeps pointing at the returned permanent for the
//! haste grant, the delayed-exile target, and the replacement host. This is
//! exactly why Unearth's *self*-return is simpler than the targeted
//! temporary-reanimation template (Goryo's Vengeance), where the reanimated
//! creature is a *different* object than the spell and the riders must instead
//! bind through `LastCreated` / `ParentTarget`.
