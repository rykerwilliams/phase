//! Dash (CR 702.109) — alternative-cost runtime riders.
//!
//! CR 702.109a: "Dash [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost]
//! rather than its mana cost," and — if the dash cost was paid — the permanent
//! it becomes has **haste**, and you **return it to its owner's hand at the
//! beginning of the next end step**.
//!
//! The alternative cost itself is wired into the casting pipeline as
//! `CastingVariant::Dash` (offered like Evoke, substituted like Warp). This
//! module owns the *resolution riders*: when a dash-cast spell resolves into a
//! permanent, [`install_dash_riders`] grants haste and schedules the end-step
//! return to hand.
//!
//! The riders are granted directly at resolution (Suspend/Warp-style) rather
//! than synthesized as tag-gated abilities: granting them only to a permanent
//! whose dash cost was paid makes their *presence* the gate, with no dependence
//! on `cast_variant_paid` surviving zone changes.
