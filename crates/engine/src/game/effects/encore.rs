//! Encore (CR 702.141) — graveyard-activated, per-opponent token-copy generator.
//!
//! CR 702.141a: "Encore [cost]" is an activated ability that functions only
//! while the card with encore is in a graveyard. It means:
//!
//! > "[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a
//! > token that's a copy of this card that attacks that opponent this turn if
//! > able. The tokens gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next
//! > end step. Activate only as a sorcery."
//!
//! The exile-from-graveyard is paid as part of the activation cost (composed in
//! `database/encore.rs`), so by the time this resolver runs the source card is
//! in exile. It keeps its `ObjectId` across the graveyard → exile cost move
//! (`game/zones.rs::move_to_zone` mutates the zone in place), so
//! `Effect::CopyTokenOf { target: SelfRef }` still resolves to the exiled card
//! and `compute_current_copiable_values` reads its printed copiable values from
//! the exile zone — exactly as Embalm / Eternalize rely on.
//!
//! This resolver mirrors `effects/myriad.rs` (CR 702.116a), Encore's closest
//! sibling: both create one copy token per opponent and bind each token to that
//! opponent. The differences are encoded here rather than in any shared effect:
//!
//! - **Per-opponent must-attack, not enters-attacking.** Encore is activated at
//!   sorcery speed (typically in a main phase, outside combat), so the tokens
//!   are *not* created already attacking. Instead each token gains a
//!   `MustAttackPlayer { player }` requirement (CR 508.1d) bound to the opponent
//!   it was created for, lasting until end of turn (CR 702.141a "this turn").
//!   Binding the requirement per opponent — instead of via the generic
//!   `Effect::ForceAttack`, whose `required_player` context ref has no
//!   "the opponent" resolution and would fall back to the controller — is the
//!   reason Encore needs a dedicated resolver.
//! - **Haste is baked into the copy** via `extra_keywords` (CR 707.2, the
//!   Twinflame "…except it has haste" channel), so each token has haste from
//!   the moment it is created.
//! - **Sacrifice at the next end step**, composed as a one-shot delayed trigger
//!   (CR 603.7d) over the exact token IDs created here, rather than Myriad's
//!   end-of-combat exile.
