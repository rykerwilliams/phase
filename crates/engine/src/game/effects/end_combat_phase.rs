/// - CR 724.2b: exile every object on the stack, including the resolving object.
/// - CR 724.2c: check state-based actions (no priority, no new triggers stacked).
/// - CR 724.2d: remove everything from combat, expire "until end of combat"
///   effects, and skip straight to the postcombat main phase (CR 724.2e: the
///   end-of-combat step and its "at end of combat" triggers are skipped).
