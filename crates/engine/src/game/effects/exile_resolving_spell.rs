//! `Effect::ExileResolvingSpellInsteadOfGraveyard` — the "exile it instead of
//! putting it into a graveyard as it resolves" self-replacement rider applied by
//! a `WhenAPlayerCasts` trigger to the spell that caused the trigger (Rod of
//! Absorption).
//!
//! CR 614.1a + CR 608.2n: "instead" makes this a replacement effect that swaps
//! the resolving spell's normal CR 608.2n graveyard destination for exile.
//! CR 607.2b + CR 406.6: the exiled spell is recorded as "exiled with" the
//! trigger source so the source's linked ability ("cast any number of spells
//! from among cards exiled with this artifact") can refer to the accumulating
//! set.
