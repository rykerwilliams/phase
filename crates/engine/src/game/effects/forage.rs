//! CR 701.61a: Forage — "Exile three cards from your graveyard or sacrifice a
//! Food." A modal keyword action, performed when an effect instructs a player
//! to "forage."
//!
//! Implemented by composition over existing effects rather than a bespoke
//! `WaitingFor`:
//!   * the exile mode reuses `Effect::ChangeZone`'s resolution-time selection
//!     (`multi_target` fixed at 3 + `TargetChoiceTiming::Resolution` + empty
//!     targets), which routes through the shared `EffectZoneChoice` picker;
//!   * the Food mode reuses `Effect::Sacrifice` (the same machinery Devour and
//!     every "sacrifice a Food" cost use);
//!   * when both modes are performable the controller chooses via
//!     `Effect::ChooseOneOf`.
//!
//! CR 701.61a is atomic per mode — you exile *three* cards or sacrifice *a*
//! Food — so a mode is offered only when it can be performed in full. If
//! neither mode is performable, foraging does nothing.
