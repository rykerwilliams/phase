//! CR 701.64: Harness — the keyword action that grants a permanent the
//! harnessed designation.
//!
//! CR 701.64a: "Harness [this permanent]" means "If this permanent isn't
//! harnessed, it becomes harnessed." Like Monstrosity (CR 701.37a), this is an
//! idempotent designation toggle with no other rules effect — there are no
//! counters or sub-choices, so the resolver simply sets the marker on the
//! source permanent.
//!
//! CR 701.64b: Harnessed is a pure marker (neither an ability nor a copiable
//! value) that stays until the permanent leaves the battlefield. The marker is
//! cleared by `GameObject::reset_for_battlefield_exit` (CR 400.7). It is read by
//! the ∞ (Infinity) ability gate (`SourceIsHarnessed`, CR 702.186b).
