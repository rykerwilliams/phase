//! Digital-only Alchemy (no CR entry): `Effect::Intensify` — increase the
//! intensity of one or more cards.
//!
//! Intensity is a per-card value (`GameObject::intensity`) that follows a card
//! through every zone. "Intensify by N" therefore applies across ALL zones, not
//! just the battlefield, and its scope is one of:
//!
//! * [`IntensityScope::Source`] — "this creature/artifact/… intensifies";
//! * [`IntensityScope::OwnedSameName`] — "cards you own named [this card]
//!   intensify" (every copy you own, anywhere);
//! * [`IntensityScope::OwnedSubtype`] — "all [subtype] cards you own intensify".
//!
//! Because `GameState::objects` is the single store of every object in every
//! zone, an owner-scoped scan over it covers hand, library, graveyard, stack,
//! exile, and battlefield uniformly.
