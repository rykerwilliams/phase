/// CR 101.4 + CR 608.2c: Publish the numbers `players` secretly chose earlier in
/// this resolution — the runtime half of "then all players reveal those numbers
/// simultaneously" (Wheel of Misfortune), "then you reveal the number you chose"
/// (The Toymaker's Trap), "Then those numbers are revealed" (Menacing Ogre).
///
/// The transition is typed, not a visibility flag: each named player's
/// `ChosenAttribute::Number` (private — `game::visibility` redacts it from every
/// other viewer) becomes `ChosenAttribute::RevealedNumber` (public). Because
/// privacy is a property of the attribute kind, this single conversion is what
/// makes the card's reveal instruction observable, and a card that never reveals
/// keeps its numbers secret with no extra bookkeeping.
///
/// CR 101.4: the reveal is SIMULTANEOUS, so every player is converted before the
/// event is emitted and one event carries the whole set. Iteration is in APNAP
/// order purely so the event's contents are deterministic (CR 101.4 fixes that
/// order for the choices themselves); no game action is sequenced by it.
///
/// CR 609.3: naming a player who chose no number does as much as possible —
/// nothing. That is what lets Wheel of Misfortune's `players: All` be correct on
/// a table where a card's choosers were only a subset (Life at Stake).
