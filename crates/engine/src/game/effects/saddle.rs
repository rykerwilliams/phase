//! CR 702.171b: effect-level "becomes saddled" resolver.
//!
//! Distinct from the Saddle keyword's activated ability (CR 702.171a,
//! resolved in `stack.rs` as `KeywordAction::Saddle`, which is paid by tapping
//! creatures with total power N or greater): this handler grants the saddled
//! designation directly, without paying the saddle cost. It backs "becomes
//! saddled" instructions — Guidelight Matrix's `{2}, {T}: Target Mount you
//! control becomes saddled`, Kolodin's `Whenever a Mount you control enters, it
//! becomes saddled`, and Alacrian Armory's combat trigger.
//!
//! CR 702.171c records the creatures that *saddle* a permanent (tapped to pay
//! the cost). An effect-granted saddle has no such creatures, so `saddled_by`
//! is left empty and the `Saddled` event carries an empty creature list.
