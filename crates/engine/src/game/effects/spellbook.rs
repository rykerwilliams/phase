//! Alchemy "draft a card from [this card]'s spellbook" (digital-only, no CR
//! entry). A spellbook is a fixed, card-specific list of card names. Drafting
//! means: reveal the list, the controller chooses one card, and that card is
//! created in a destination zone.
//!
//! This composes two existing building blocks rather than reinventing them:
//!
//! * the interactive choice pauses on [`WaitingFor::SpellbookDraft`] (resumed by
//!   `GameAction::SubmitSpellbookDraft` in `engine.rs`); and
//! * the card creation delegates to [`super::conjure`] — the chosen name is
//!   conjured into the destination, reusing the registry lookup, characteristic
//!   application, summoning-sickness reset and ETB zone-change emission.
//!
//! The spellbook list itself is not in the Oracle text — it is carried on the
//! source object (`GameObject::spellbook`, copied from
//! `CardFace::metadata.spellbook`); the resolver reads it from the source.
