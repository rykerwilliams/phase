//! CR 701.56a: Time travel — "choose any number of permanents you control with
//! one or more time counters on them and/or suspended cards you own in exile
//! with one or more time counters on them and, for each of those objects, put a
//! time counter on it or remove a time counter from it."
//!
//! Modeled like Proliferate (`WaitingFor::ProliferateChoice`), but with a
//! per-object add/remove decision. To reuse `GameAction::SelectTargets` without
//! a new action variant, the choice runs in two phases over
//! `WaitingFor::TimeTravelChoice`. `TimeTravelPhase::Remove` is offered first:
//! the player selects the objects to remove a time counter from (the common
//! case — advancing suspended cards toward casting). `TimeTravelPhase::Add`
//! then runs over the still-eligible remainder, selecting the
//! objects to add a time counter to. An object selected in the remove phase is
//! excluded from the add phase, so each object gets at most one of add/remove
//! (CR 701.56a "for each of those objects, put ... or remove ...").
//!
//! All consequences of the counter changes — the suspend last-counter free-cast
//! trigger and Vanishing's last-counter sacrifice — are handled by the existing
//! `CounterAdded`/`CounterRemoved` triggers; this resolver only drives the
//! counter primitives.
