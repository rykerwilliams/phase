//! CR 116.2c: the "pay a cost to end a continuous effect" special action.
//!
//! > 116.2c Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time,
//! > usually to end a continuous effect [...]. Doing so is a special action. A
//! > player can take such an action any time they have priority, unless that
//! > effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as the effect
//! > allows it.
//!
//! The shipped class is the Licid cycle ("You may pay {W} to end this effect").
//! Nothing in this module knows what a Licid or an Aura is: the permission rides
//! on the [`TransientContinuousEffect`] the creating resolution installed
//! (`end_permission`), so any future card that grants a mana-paid termination
//! permission is handled without a line of new code here.
//!
//! Mirrors `game::companion`'s seven-function shape (CR 116.2g), with ONE
//! deliberate divergence: `companion.rs` hard-gates its action to a sorcery-speed
//! window because CR 116.2g states that restriction. CR 116.2c states none, and
//! neither do the shipped cards, so this action has **no** phase gate, **no**
//! empty-stack gate, and **no** active-player gate. Calming Licid's printed
//! ruling (2013-04-15) and Flanking Licid's (2024-11-08) both say the payment is
//! a special action taken at priority that can't be responded to (CR 116.1 —
//! special actions don't use the stack).
