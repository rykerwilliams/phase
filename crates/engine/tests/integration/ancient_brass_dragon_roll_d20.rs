//! Reproduction for issue #1602, Deliverable 2 — Ancient Brass Dragon's
//! reflexive graveyard reanimation gated by an aggregate mana-value cap.
//!
//! Oracle (Ancient Brass Dragon):
//! > Flying
//! > Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, roll a d20. When
//! > you do, put any number of target creature cards with total mana value X or
//! > less from graveyards onto the battlefield under your control, where X is
//! > the result.
//!
//! The bug: the reflexive `ChangeZone` dropped the graveyard origin, the
//! "total mana value X or less" cap, and the "any number of target" multi-target
//! spec — so it tried to put battlefield creatures, ignored the cap, and left X
//! unbound (resolving to 0). Deliverable 2 routes the cap through a typed
//! `TargetSelectionConstraint::TotalManaValue` bound to the die result and
//! enforces it during target legality.
//!
//! This test drives real combat (unblocked 6/5 flyer → 6 combat damage), reads
//! the carried d20 result, and asserts:
//!   (a) an over-cap selection (a single card whose MV exceeds the roll) is
//!       REJECTED;
//!   (b) the legal targets all satisfy the cap and live in a graveyard, and
//!       selecting them moves them onto the battlefield under the Brass
//!       controller (FROM the graveyard, not the battlefield);
//!   (c) selecting zero targets is a clean no-op (unlimited targeting permits 0).
