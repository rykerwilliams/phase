//! Archnemesis — "Whenever you attack enchanted player, that player loses 2
//! life. You draw a card and gain 2 life."
//!
//! Before the fix this clause parsed as a bare `YouAttack` trigger with
//! `LoseLife { target: TriggeringPlayer }` and no defender scope, so:
//!   1. the *controller* (you) lost 2 life instead of the enchanted player, and
//!   2. the trigger fired on *any* attack the controller declared, not only
//!      attacks against the enchanted player.
//!
//! The fix routes the clause through the shared "attacks enchanted player"
//! grammar (`Attacks` mode, `valid_source = Controller`,
//! `valid_target = AttachedTo`, `attack_target_filter = Player`) and binds the
//! "that player" anaphor to the defender captured at attack declaration via
//! `TargetFilter::DefendingPlayer`.
//!
//! These tests drive the real combat pipeline (declare attackers → attack
//! trigger onto the stack → resolve). Combat damage is isolated out by clearing
//! the declared attackers after the trigger fires (mirrors
//! `attack_qualifier_stack_conditions.rs`), so the asserted life deltas come
//! solely from the resolved trigger.
//!
