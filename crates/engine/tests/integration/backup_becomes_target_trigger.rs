//! CR 702.165a — "becomes the target of a backup ability" trigger (Huge Truck class).
//!
//! A creature with "Whenever another creature you control becomes the target of a
//! backup ability, draw a card." must fire when one of its controller's other
//! creatures is targeted by a Backup keyword ability specifically — and must NOT
//! fire when targeted by an unrelated (non-backup) spell or ability.
//!
//! The synthesized Backup ETB ability (`synthesize_backup`) is stamped with
//! `AbilityTag::Backup`; the trigger's `valid_source` is
//! `TargetFilter::StackAbility { tag: Some(AbilityTag::Backup), kind: None }`, honored at
//! runtime by `stack_ability_matches_filter` (CR 113.7a — the ability exists on
//! the stack independently of its source, so the tag is read off the resolved
//! ability). The backup ETB targets `target creature` (CR 115.1d), so locking
//! that target emits `GameEvent::BecomesTarget` (CR 603.3d).
