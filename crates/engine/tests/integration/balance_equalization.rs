//! Balance ({1}{W} sorcery) — end-to-end equalization.
//!
//! Oracle: "Each player chooses a number of lands they control equal to the
//! number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then
//! sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same
//! way."
//!
//! Balance lowers (via `try_parse_balance_equalization`) to a three-link
//! `sub_ability` chain — sacrifice lands, discard cards, sacrifice creatures —
//! each a `player_scope: All` effect whose count is
//! `Difference { per-player count, cross-player minimum }`. This test drives
//! the parsed ability through `resolve_ability_chain` against an asymmetric
//! board and asserts every player is reduced to the per-zone minimum, proving:
//!   - the player-scope APNAP fan-out,
//!   - the `QuantityExpr::Difference` disposal count,
//!   - the `ControlledByEachPlayer` / `HandSize { AllPlayers }` resolvers,
//!   - the §8 clause-local minimum snapshot (each clause's minimum is locked
//!     against its own pre-clause board), and
//!   - the interactive `EffectZoneChoice` / `DiscardChoice` round-trip.
