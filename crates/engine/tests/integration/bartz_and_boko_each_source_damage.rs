//! Runtime discriminator: the filter-source own-power damage class — "each other
//! <type> you control deals damage equal to its power to <recipient>" — parsed to
//! `Effect::EachSourceDealsDamage` with a per-batch-source `Power { BatchSource }`
//! amount, resolved PER SOURCE (each member is the source of its own damage,
//! CR 120.1), NOT resolved once against the ability source.
//!
//! Card under test: Bartz and Boko's ETB trigger:
//!   "When Bartz and Boko enters, each other Bird you control deals damage equal
//!    to its power to target creature an opponent controls."
//!
//! The board is sized so the assertions DISCRIMINATE every failure mode:
//!   - Correct per-source resolution: 4/4 + 5/5 = 9 damage ≥ 9 toughness kills the
//!     opponent's 0/9 target (CR 120.6 damage marking; CR 704.5g lethal-damage
//!     state-based action).
//!   - A resolver reading the amount once against the ability source (Bartz, 4)
//!     and applying it per source deals 4 + 4 = 8 < 9 → target survives.
//!   - A resolver reading once against the FIRST batch member (the 4/4, placed
//!     first so the batch iterates 4/4 → 5/5) deals 4 + 4 = 8 < 9 → survives.
//!   - The pre-fix parser misparse (single `DealDamage` at Bartz's own 4 once)
//!     deals 4 < 9 → survives.
//!   - A fail-closed resolver (`damage_source` unset → 0) deals 0 → survives.
//!
//! The correct arm is the ONLY one that kills the 0/9.
//!
//! `objects_that_dealt_damage` is keyed per source (deal_damage.rs), so the
//! attribution assertion (BOTH Birds marked, Bartz NOT) pairs with — but does not
//! substitute for — the creature-dies threshold (a uniform-amount resolver still
//! keys per source and would satisfy attribution alone).
//!
//! CR 120.1: the object that deals damage is the source of that damage.
//! CR 120.6: lethal damage is total marked damage ≥ toughness (definition).
//! CR 704.5g: a creature with lethal damage marked on it is destroyed (SBA).
//! CR 608.2h: LKI fallback for sources that leave the battlefield mid-batch.
//! CR 208.1 + CR 608.2: a creature's power is a modifiable characteristic read at
//!            resolution.
