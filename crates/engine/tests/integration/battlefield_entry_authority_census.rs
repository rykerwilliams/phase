//! STRUCTURAL CENSUS over the FUSED battlefield-entry event pair and the anaphora slot behind it.
//! Three anchors, one instrument:
//!
//! * `GameEvent::ZoneChanged` — every production construction in `crates/engine/src` whose `from`
//!   field carries NO origin zone (spelled `from: None` or written in field-init shorthand) must
//!   live inside `zones::record_and_emit_entry_from_no_zone`, the single
//!   `from: None → Battlefield` record+emit authority, except three sites adjudicated BY NAME.
//! * `GameEvent::TokenCreated` — every production construction must live inside
//!   `token::push_committed_token_entry_events`, the single emitter, except one site adjudicated
//!   BY NAME. See the SECOND ANCHOR section below.
//! * SINGLE-ID PUBLISHES into either anaphora container (`state.last_created_token_ids` and
//!   `PendingCopyTokenResolution::created_ids`) — every production one must live inside
//!   `token::record_last_created_token` or `token::record_last_created_copy_batch_token`. No
//!   adjudicated survivors. See the THIRD ANCHOR section below.
//!
//! The first two anchors share [`literal_body`] and [`classify_anchor`]; all three share
//! `cfg_test_scoped_lines`, [`rs_files`] and the [`top_level_fn_headers`] / [`enclosing_fn`] scope
//! resolver. A second copy of that machinery would drift away from this one.
//!
//! CR 400.7 + CR 608.2i + CR 603.2c: `GameObject::snapshot_for_zone_change` leaves
//! `turn_zone_change_index` at a `0` placeholder for `restrictions::record_zone_change` to
//! overwrite. An entry that emits its `ZoneChanged` without reaching the recorder ships that
//! placeholder, so the CR 603.2c batched zone-change replay guard aliases it onto occurrence `0`
//! and `Ability::self_ref_own_departure_successor` subscripts a ledger row belonging to a DIFFERENT
//! object.
//!
//! COUNT, MEASURED on the pre-change tree (`b654513cb`), not recalled: SIX production writers had
//! the defect — `conjure.rs:213`, `counters.rs:535`, `counters.rs:839`, `gift_delivery.rs:168`,
//! `token_copy.rs:859`, `token_copy.rs:973`. Two more sites wrote the same
//! `from: None → Battlefield` shape but already routed through the recorder (`incubate.rs:128`,
//! `token.rs:1960`), for eight writers total. Fusing record and emit removes the call-site seam
//! the six were written through, and this census is the tripwire for a SEVENTH.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. It is a SOURCE-TEXT instrument, so it is a tripwire against an
//! accidental clone, NOT a proof that one cannot be written. Three measured ceilings, all of them
//! real:
//!
//! * It cannot see a construction assembled through a helper that takes `from` as a parameter,
//!   nor one built by a macro. Neither exists today: the only non-`GameEvent::`-prefixed
//!   `ZoneChanged {` occurrences in `engine/src` are comments and the enum declaration in
//!   `types/events.rs`.
//! * A construction written ENTIRELY in field-init shorthand
//!   (`GameEvent::ZoneChanged { object_id, from, to, record }`) is textually identical to a
//!   destructuring pattern, so [`is_construction`] cannot separate them and the census skips it.
//!   This is the one FAIL-OPEN ceiling, and it is kept deliberately. The second anchor's
//!   [`is_token_construction`] closes the same ceiling by keying on FIELD COMPLETENESS, and
//!   backporting that predicate here was MEASURED rather than assumed: over `engine/src` it takes
//!   this anchor from the pinned 4 production / 10 test hits to 16 / 13, and every one of the 15
//!   additions is a destructuring CONSUMER (`let … else`, `if let`, match arms in
//!   `types/game_state.rs` x4, `game/triggers.rs` x2, `trigger_matchers.rs`, `trigger_index.rs`,
//!   `filter.rs`, `derived_views.rs`, `visibility.rs`, `merge_tests.rs`) — zero are constructions.
//!   The asymmetry is empirical, not structural: `TokenCreated`'s three fields are never all bound
//!   by a consumer (the widest elides one, `{ object_id, source_id, .. }`), while `ZoneChanged`'s
//!   four are routinely all bound because consumers need every one of them. So the mirror-image
//!   ceiling is fail-CLOSED in direction but not in magnitude — it would replace the pin with a
//!   12-file consumer list that churns on every unrelated edit, which is the exact outcome arm
//!   4(iii) exists to prevent. The same sweep found NO all-shorthand `ZoneChanged` construction in
//!   `engine/src`, so the ceiling is currently unexercised.
//! * Conversely, a PATTERN that renames a field (`record: rec`) reads as a construction and would
//!   be counted. That direction is fail-CLOSED — it can only ADD an unexpected hit and fail the
//!   exact multiset below. No such pattern exists in `engine/src` today (measured).
//!
//! STRUCTURAL COMPLETENESS, ENFORCED BY STRUCTURE — NEVER BY SUBSTRING. Round 3 of this census
//! keyed on the substring `from: None` inside a fixed six-line window from the anchor. Both halves
//! were evadable, and both evasions COMPILE (each is now a permanent arm of the anti-vacuity test
//! below, forms 6 and 7):
//!
//! 1. `let from = None;` followed by field-init shorthand `from,` — the value is still `None`, but
//!    the substring `from: None` never appears.
//! 2. Writing the `record:` field first as a multi-line `Box::new(…)` expression, which pushes
//!    `from: None` past the sixth line.
//!
//! Both are closed by scanning the literal's OWN extent (brace depth, [`literal_body`]) and by
//! classifying the `from` FIELD rather than matching a spelling of it.
//!
//! A THIRD THROUGH SIXTH evasion of the same instrument were found in rounds 8, 10 and 12, and
//! unlike the first two they are FAIL-OPEN — they REMOVE a hit rather than adding one:
//!
//! 3. An ordinary prose comment inside the literal carrying an unbalanced `}`. The brace scan
//!    counted it as the literal's closing brace and returned a TRUNCATED body, so every field
//!    written after the comment went unseen. This also defeated arm 4(ii), whose comment is
//!    brace-free and so never reached the scan.
//! 4. The same truncation through a `}` inside a string literal.
//! 5. The same truncation through a NESTED block comment. Rust block comments nest; the scan
//!    tracked them with a BOOL, so `/* outer /* inner */ } */` left comment state at the inner
//!    `*/` and the `}` truncated the body. This one survived the rewrite that closed 3 and 4, and
//!    the residual list that rewrite shipped did not name it.
//! 6. The same truncation through a RAW BYTE / RAW C string (`br#"…"#`, `cr#"…"#`). `b` and `c`
//!    are alphanumeric, so the guard that stops an identifier's trailing `r` opening a raw string
//!    rejected these too, and the `"` after it fell through to the `#`-blind escaped-string scan.
//!    The residual list that closed 5 did NOT name this one either, because that list said it was
//!    "derived from the branches the scanner actually has" — and a branch the scanner does not
//!    have is exactly what such a derivation cannot see. [`literal_body`]'s list is therefore now
//!    derived from an EXTERNAL basis: the Rust Reference's enumeration of tokens whose interior
//!    text is not code, each mapped to the branch that consumes it.
//!
//! All four are closed in [`literal_body`] — comment/string/char skipping for 3 and 4, a comment
//! DEPTH counter for 5, [`literal_prefix_start`] for 6 — and all four are permanent arms (1d, and
//! 4(iv) for the second anchor), each paired with the SAME literal carrying a balanced comment, a
//! non-nested comment, or an unprefixed raw string as its control, so each pair measures its
//! specific evasion rather than comments or raw strings in general.
//!
//! SEPARATELY, TWO MEASURED CEILINGS in the reused `cfg_test_scoped_lines` scope classifier (these
//! are about test/production SCOPING, not about finding the literal), both FAIL-CLOSED here:
//!
//! 1. Its rule is `opens_module || next.trim_end().ends_with('{')`, so a `#[cfg(test)]` item whose
//!    `fn` signature spans multiple lines (header ending in `(`) is never scoped. Live instance:
//!    `trigger_matchers.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) fn test_trigger_source_context(`.
//! 2. It matches only the literal string `#[cfg(test)]`, so
//!    `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]` is never scoped either. Live instance:
//!    `ability.rs`'s `set_test_trigger_source_recursive`.
//!
//! Both are fail-CLOSED for THIS census because CONJUNCT 1 pins the production hit set as an EXACT
//! per-file multiset in which absent files must not appear: a mis-scoped test hit can only ADD an
//! unexpected file/count and FAIL, never let a real clone through. Fixing the classifier would move
//! `loop_shortcut_offer_writer_census`'s own pinned numbers, which is out of this change's scope.
//! Arm 1 of the anti-vacuity test MEASURES ceiling 1 rather than asserting it.
//!
//! ── SECOND ANCHOR: `GameEvent::TokenCreated` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS. The `ZoneChanged` anchor above pins only HALF of the fused pair. The other half
//! is the one this change moved: the `TokenCreated` emit was hoisted out of eight call sites into
//! `token::push_committed_token_entry_events` and gated on the recorder's own verdict. Until this
//! anchor existed, that half was protected by nothing but the fact that exactly one production
//! emit site happens to exist today — i.e. by ENUMERATION, the instrument the change argues
//! against. A new `events.push(GameEvent::TokenCreated { … })` written anywhere else tripped
//! nothing.
//!
//! COUNT, MEASURED on this tree, not recalled: 38 anchor occurrences in `engine/src`, of which
//! exactly TWO are production-scope constructions — the emitter (`effects/token.rs`, inside
//! `push_committed_token_entry_events`) and the adjudicated `stack.rs` probe. The other 10
//! constructions are `#[cfg(test)]`-scoped and the remaining 26 are consumer PATTERNS.
//!
//! THE CONSTRUCTION PREDICATE IS DIFFERENT HERE, AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT. `ZoneChanged`
//! keys on an explicit `record:` initializer, so it cannot see a construction written entirely in
//! field-init shorthand — that is ceiling 2 above. The token emitter IS written entirely in
//! shorthand (`{ object_id, name, source_id }`), so reusing that predicate would have made this
//! anchor blind to the one site it exists to pin. [`is_token_construction`] therefore keys on
//! FIELD COMPLETENESS, which is Rust's own rule rather than a spelling: a struct-variant
//! EXPRESSION must initialise every field (enum variants admit no `..base` functional update),
//! while a PATTERN may elide any of them with `..`. Naming all three of
//! [`TOKEN_CREATED_FIELDS`] therefore counts every construction with NO false negatives.
//!
//! Its one ceiling is the mirror image and is fail-CLOSED: an EXHAUSTIVE pattern that binds all
//! three fields (`GameEvent::TokenCreated { object_id, name, source_id }`) is textually identical
//! to a construction and would be counted, ADDING an unexpected hit to the exact multiset below.
//! MEASURED: no such pattern exists in `engine/src` today — every consumer elides at least one
//! field, the widest being `effects/destroy.rs`'s `{ object_id, source_id, .. }`.
//!
//! The other ceilings carry over verbatim, for the same reasons and in the same direction:
//!
//! * A construction assembled through a helper taking the fields as parameters, or built by a
//!   macro, is invisible. Neither exists today: the only non-`GameEvent::`-prefixed
//!   `TokenCreated {` occurrence in `engine/src` is the enum declaration in `types/events.rs`.
//! * `cfg_test_scoped_lines`'s two scope ceilings are fail-CLOSED here for exactly the reason
//!   they are above — a mis-scoped test hit can only ADD an unexpected file to the per-file
//!   production multiset and FAIL, never let a real clone through.
//! * COMPLETENESS ACROSS CRATES, MEASURED: `GameEvent::TokenCreated` occurs in no crate outside
//!   `crates/engine/`. The four occurrences under `crates/engine/tests/**` are acceptance-row
//!   consumers of this surface, not members of it, and that tree is deliberately not walked.
//!
//! RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED: the function-scope conjunct pins only the `token.rs`
//! hit. A second production construction written inside `stack.rs` that ALSO deleted the probe
//! would keep the multiset intact and pass. That is the same residual the `ZoneChanged` half
//! carries for each of its three non-authority files; closing it would mean a per-file enclosing-fn
//! pin on files whose hits are adjudicated survivors rather than authorities.
//!
//! ── THIRD ANCHOR: the SINGLE-ID ANAPHORA PUBLISH ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS. The two anchors above pin the two halves of the entry EVENT. The defect that
//! actually shipped in this change's round 9 and round 10 was neither: it was a single just-created
//! id published into the `TargetFilter::LastCreated` anaphora slot WITHOUT the object-existence
//! predicate — first into `state.last_created_token_ids` directly, then, after that was guarded,
//! into `PendingCopyTokenResolution::created_ids` one line BELOW the guard, which the copy-batch
//! drain assigns wholesale back onto ledger 3 and so republished the id the guard had withheld.
//! Four successive enumeration sweeps each declared that class closed. Its closure then rested on a
//! query written in a doc comment, i.e. on the same ENUMERATION this file's other two anchors exist
//! to replace. This anchor is that query made executable.
//!
//! WHAT IT KEYS ON, and why it inherits none of [`literal_body`]'s residuals: a method CALL, not a
//! struct-literal body. There is no brace scan, no comment/string/char skipping and no
//! construction-vs-pattern predicate — the anchor is the container's FIELD ACCESS and the verdict
//! is the next code token after it ([`call_tail`], then [`is_single_id_publish`] or
//! [`is_ambiguous_mutator`]). The FOUR fail-OPEN truncations that rounds 8, 10 and 12 found in
//! [`literal_body`] — evasions 3 through 6 — are therefore structurally absent here rather than
//! argued absent. (Four truncations, three rounds: round 12's byte-raw and raw-C prefixes are one
//! evasion with two spellings, and an earlier revision of this sentence counted the ROUNDS.)
//!
//! THE TAIL VOCABULARY, MEASURED on this tree rather than assumed — every distinct next-token form
//! following `.last_created_token_ids` or `.created_ids` in `engine/src`, over 157 field accesses:
//! `=` 39 (bulk assign), `[` 26 (indexed read), `.clone(` 25, `.len(` 19, `.is_empty(` 12,
//! `.iter(` 8, `;` 5, `{` 5 (a `for … in &state.last_created_token_ids {` header), `.extend(` 5,
//! `.contains(` 3, `.first(` 3, `)` 3, `.push(` 2, `.clear(` 1, `,` 1. `.push(` occurs exactly
//! TWICE, both inside the two authorities. NO tail begins with `/*`, which is what makes the
//! block-comment residual below latent rather than live.
//!
//! WHAT THE CLASSIFIER DOES WITH THAT VOCABULARY IS NOT DERIVED FROM IT — the derivation basis is
//! `std`'s method semantics, for the same reason [`literal_body`]'s residual list had to stop being
//! derived from the branches the scanner happened to have. `.push(` / `.insert(` always introduce
//! exactly one element; `.extend(` / `.append(` / `.resize(` / `.splice(` introduce one only for
//! arguments this scanner cannot read, so they are PINNED by conjunct 4 rather than judged;
//! `.clear(` / `.retain(` / `.truncate(` / `.remove(` / `.drain(` / `.pop(` cannot introduce an
//! element at all. `.insert(`, `.append(`, `.resize(` and `.splice(` occur zero times today and are
//! covered anyway — a classifier that only knew the spellings present in the tree is a classifier
//! that closes nothing. See [`is_single_id_publish`] and [`is_ambiguous_mutator`].
//!
//! THE RESIDUALS, all fail-OPEN unless noted, each measured:
//!
//! * A publish through an ALIAS (`let v = &mut state.last_created_token_ids; v.push(id);`) is
//!   invisible: the alias's own `.push` carries neither container name. The same query covers the
//!   UFCS form `Vec::push(&mut state.last_created_token_ids, id)`, whose tail is a bare `,`.
//!   MEASURED absent —
//!   `rg -n --pcre2 -U '&\s*mut\s+\w+\.(last_created_token_ids|created_ids)' crates/engine/src`
//!   exits 1 with no output, against a positive control of 89 match events for
//!   `&\s*mut\s+\w+\.objects` under the identical query shape. This is the direct analogue of the
//!   other two anchors' helper/macro ceiling.
//! * An INDEXED ASSIGNMENT (`state.last_created_token_ids[0] = id;`) introduces an id under a tail
//!   this anchor reads as `[`, which is also the 26 indexed READS. Deliberately NOT classified:
//!   separating them needs bracket matching plus a lookahead past the `]`, i.e. the fixed-window
//!   guess [`literal_body`]'s doc rejects, and counting `[` wholesale would move the conjunct-1 pin
//!   from `(2, 0)` to `(3, 25)`, its production multiset from `{effects/token.rs: 2}` to
//!   `{database/encore_tests.rs: 1, effects/token.rs: 2}`, and the files it touches from one to
//!   seven — 25 of the 26 `[` tails are `#[cfg(test)]` fixtures reading `…_ids[0]`, so the pin
//!   would churn on every new test that reads the ledger. MEASURED absent instead:
//!   `rg -n --pcre2 -U '\.(last_created_token_ids|created_ids)\s*\[[^\]]*\]\s*=[^=]'
//!   crates/engine/src` exits 1 with no output, against a positive control of 211 match events for
//!   `\w\s*\[[^\]]*\]\s*=[^=]` under the identical query shape.
//! * A block comment BETWEEN the field and its method call is a tail [`call_tail`] cannot read.
//!   Made fail-CLOSED by counting it — see [`is_single_id_publish`], arm 5(vi).
//! * PROSE that quotes the defect is skipped only in the three shapes [`code_span`] and the
//!   full-line rule handle: a full-line `//`, a leading `/* … */`, and a trailing `//` not preceded
//!   by a `"`. A `//` after a quote, a `/* … */` opened mid-line, a string literal containing the
//!   container-plus-verb text, and the interior lines of a multi-line block comment are still
//!   scanned. That residue is fail-CLOSED — it can only ADD a hit and fail the exact multiset,
//!   never hide a publish. MEASURED over every OCCURRENCE rather than every matching line: of 184
//!   container-name occurrences in `engine/src`, 27 sit in a full-line `//` and 157 are ordinary
//!   code — the same 157 the tail vocabulary above enumerates — and ZERO sit in any of the four
//!   residue shapes today.
//! * A publish into a container reached by a name this anchor does not know is invisible. The
//!   container set is closed by type rather than by search: `TargetFilter::LastCreated` reads
//!   `state.last_created_token_ids` (`game/filter.rs`, `game/targeting.rs`) and the only other
//!   writer of that field is the copy-batch drain's wholesale assign from
//!   `PendingCopyTokenResolution::created_ids`. Those are the two names.

///
/// THE RESIDUALS THAT REMAIN, each MEASURED rather than argued:
///
/// * An unterminated struct literal (only reachable on syntactically invalid source, which would

///   `chars.len()` when they reach the end of the line without finding one, which ends the inner
///   `while at < chars.len()` loop; the outer loop then advances `row` and resumes brace counting
///   on line 2 of the string. So the hazard is a `}` on the SECOND or later line of a string inside
///   an anchor literal, closing the literal early and truncating the captured body. It is NOT, as
///   an earlier revision of this residual said, the remainder of the FIRST line: that part is
///   inside the string and is correctly skipped, exactly as a terminated string's interior is.
///   Fail-OPEN. RAW strings behave identically, through [`skip_raw`]'s own `chars.len()` return,
///   and they are the COMMON multi-line form in Rust — MEASURED: of 156 raw-string openers in
///   `engine/src` (`(?<![A-Za-z0-9_])(b|c)?r#*"`, counted per occurrence), 28 have no closing
///   delimiter on the same line, several of them brace-dense JSON fixtures in
///   `database/card_db.rs` and `database/mtgjson.rs`. The earlier revision named neither the raw
///   form nor the right line.
///   What keeps this LATENT is the population this scanner actually walks — the anchor LINES, not
///   the subset it keeps: 326 `ZoneChanged` and 38 `TokenCreated` anchor lines in `engine/src`, of

///   the inner `*/` of `/* outer /* inner */ } */` ends comment state and the `}` truncates the
///   body. MEASURED absent from `engine/src` with a query that can actually EXPRESS the multi-line
///   form: `rg --pcre2 -U --multiline-dotall --json '/\*(?:(?!\*/).)*?/\*' crates/engine/src` → 0
///   match events. Its positive control is synthetic, because the tree has no live instance:
///   `printf 'fn a() {\n/* outer\n   /* inner */ }\n*/\n}\n' > /tmp/pc/nested.rs` then the same
///   query over `/tmp/pc` → 1. The LINE-ORIENTED query an earlier revision shipped
///   (`rg -n --pcre2 '/\*.*/\*'`) returns 0 on that same file, i.e. it was blind to the very
///   hazard it claimed to have measured absent. Arm 1d / evasion 5 pins the fix, with a NON-nested
///   block comment carrying the same stray `}` as its control.
/// * [`classify_anchor`] scans each line for the FIRST occurrence of ITS needle only, so two
///   constructions of the SAME anchor on ONE source line score 1. Fail-OPEN. MEASURED absent:
///   `rg --pcre2 -U --multiline-dotall --json 'GameEvent::ZoneChanged \{[^\n]*GameEvent::ZoneChanged
