//! CR 115.1 + CR 603.2e + CR 608.2c — Black Bolt, Inhuman King (Lethal Voice).
//!
//! Verbatim Oracle text:
//!   Flying
//!   Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, Black Bolt gets +2/+2 until end of turn.
//!   Lethal Voice — Whenever Black Bolt becomes the target of a spell or ability an
//!     opponent controls, destroy target nonland permanent that player controls.
//!
//! "That player" is the controller of the *targeting* source — the opponent
//! (CR 608.2c, "apply the rules of English to the text," reads the effect's "that
//! player" anaphor as referring back to the player named by the trigger
//! condition; CR 603.2e fires on the "becomes the target" event; CR 115.1 fixes
//! the source's target when it is put on the stack). The parser previously
//! lowered "that player controls" to `ControllerRef::You`, so Lethal Voice
//! offered/destroyed one of BLACK BOLT'S OWN permanents. This test drives the
//! real pipeline: an opponent (P1) targets Black Bolt with a spell P1 controls,
//! and Lethal Voice must be able to destroy a nonland permanent P1 controls —
//! never one of P0's own.

/// Fixture (multi-authority): P0 controls Black Bolt AND a nonland permanent of
/// its own (Grizzly Bears). P1 controls TWO nonland permanents (so P0 must be
/// prompted to choose between them rather than the engine auto-selecting a lone
/// legal target) and the targeting spell. When P1 targets Black Bolt, the Lethal
/// Voice trigger's destroy slot must offer only P1's permanents, and destroying
/// one must resolve.
///
/// Revert-failing seam: the trigger's target-legality set is computed at
/// `game/filter.rs::controller_ref_player`'s `TriggeringPlayer` arm →
/// `triggering_event_player` → `extract_player_from_event`'s `BecomesTarget`
/// arm. Pre-fix (`ControllerRef::You`) that set is P0's permanents, so both the
/// candidate-list assertions and the destroy outcome flip.
