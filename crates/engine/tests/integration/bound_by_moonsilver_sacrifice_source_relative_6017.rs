//! Issue #6017 regression guard — Bound by Moonsilver's activated cost
//! "Sacrifice another permanent" must stay SOURCE-relative.
//!
//! Oracle:
//!   Enchant creature
//!   Enchanted creature can't attack, block, or transform.
//!   Sacrifice another permanent: Attach this Aura to target creature.
//!   Activate only as a sorcery and only once each turn.
//!
//! The cost filter parses to `Typed(Permanent, [Another])`. `FilterProp::Another`
//! is *source-relative* (CR 613.4c / the reverted global change): the ability's
//! source is the AURA, so "another permanent" means "a permanent other than the
//! Aura." After the Aura is attached, it is NOT a legal sacrifice for its own
//! cost, while every OTHER permanent — including the enchanted host — IS legal.
//!
//! This pins the invariant that the Martial Impetus fix (#6025) must NOT touch:
//! the attachment-trigger "each other creature" retarget is scoped to a
//! trigger's mass-effect population (`valid_card == AttachedTo`), never to this
//! activated-ability sacrifice cost. Driving the REAL activation pipeline, the
//! engine surfaces the eligible sacrifice set as `WaitingFor::PayCost.choices`
//! (game/casting.rs::find_eligible_sacrifice_targets →
//! FilterContext::from_source, casting.rs:14715).
//!
//! CR 118.3: a sacrifice cost is paid by moving a permanent you control to its
//! owner's graveyard (verified: docs/MagicCompRules.txt).
//! CR 613.4c: outside per-recipient layer contexts, "other" is source-relative.
