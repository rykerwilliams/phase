//! Runtime pipeline regression for issue #5653 — Chains of Mephistopheles /
//! Magus of the Chains.
//!
//! Oracle text: "If a player would draw a card except the first one they draw
//! in each of their draw steps, that player discards a card instead. If the
//! player discards a card this way, they draw a card. If the player doesn't
//! discard a card this way, they mill a card."
//!
//! The draw and mill branches are mutually exclusive on whether the discard
//! actually removed a card: a nonempty hand discards then draws (no mill); an
//! empty hand fails to discard, so the player mills instead of drawing (no
//! draw). Each scenario stocks the library with TWO cards so an unconditional
//! chain (both Draw and Mill firing regardless of the discard's outcome) is
//! distinguishable from the correct either/or behavior — with only one library
//! card, an unconditional Draw would exhaust the library before Mill could act,
//! making the bug invisible.
