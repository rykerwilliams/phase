//! t96 — RUNTIME PROBES for the cost-X channel. Measures, never assumes.
//!
//! The charter's premise is that an unrewritten `QuantityRef::Variable{"X"}` in a cost-X
//! ability "fabricates 0". That is a claim about the RUNTIME, and the runtime has a fallback
//! chain the parser cannot see (`game/quantity.rs`, `resolve_ref`):
//!
//!     Variable{"X"}  ->  ability.chosen_x
//!                    ->  current_trigger_event -> extract_source_from_event -> obj.cost_x_paid
//!                    ->  0
//!
//! So a residual X fabricates ONLY where BOTH links are dead. These probes drive the real
//! cast/activate pipeline and read the resulting board, so each MEASURES which case it is
//! rather than predicting it.
//!
//! HARNESS NOTE (learned the hard way): `add_card_to_hand` builds a name-only object
//! "without rules text" — a probe built on it is VACUOUS and reads 0 for everything, which
//! looks exactly like a fabrication. Every card below is therefore synthesized from its
//! VERBATIM Oracle text (pool export, `cargo export-cards`) via the `*_from_oracle` builders,
//! and the control below exists precisely to catch a regression back into that vacuum.
