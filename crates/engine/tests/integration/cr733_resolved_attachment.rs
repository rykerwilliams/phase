//! CR733 P2 coverage for the attachment family.
//!
//! `attach::attach_to`, `attach::attach_to_player`, and `attach::unattach` are
//! the three authorities every production attachment edit funnels through — the
//! `Attach` effect, equip and bestow resolution, ETB "enters attached", token
//! creation, counter-driven attach, `return_as_aura`, and the unattach costs —
//! but each wrote its mutation raw. A retained-prefix replay therefore had no
//! record of who was attached to whom.
//!
//! The three authorities share ONE command rather than three sibling variants:
//! they are the same graph mutation parameterized by the resulting host, and
//! `Option<AttachTarget>` — the type the object already stores — expresses
//! object host, player host, and unattached as leaf values.
//!
//! CR 613.7e + CR 701.3c is why the timestamp must be recorded: attaching to a
//! different host draws a NEW timestamp that orders the attachment against
//! continuous effects, so a replay that re-draws one silently reorders the layer
//! system.
//!
//! The test drives the REAL pipeline — a `GameAction::ActivateAbility` equip
//! activation resolving off the stack — so the edit is produced by the
//! production resolver, not by a direct call to the authority. The Equipment is
//! already on the battlefield, so its incarnation is stable across the action and
//! the recorded command can be replayed against the captured predecessor state.
