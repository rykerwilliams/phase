//! CR 614.6 + CR 614.15 — a CROSS-LINE "instead" self-replacement override is a
//! BRANCH of the ability it replaces, never an independent sibling ability.
//!
//! CR 614.6:  "If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event
//!             occurs instead."
//! CR 614.15: self-replacement effects "replace part or all of that spell or
//!             ability's own effect(s) … the text can be a separate ability,
//!             particularly when preceded by an ability word."
//!
//! CR 614.15 is the authority for this class: the override is printed as its own
//! ability-word LINE ("Corrupted — …", "Spell mastery — …"), but it replaces the
//! PREVIOUS printed line's effect. The parser has a cross-line binder for exactly
//! this (oracle.rs), but its gate recognized only WHOLE-clause overrides (a bare
//! trailing "instead"). It did not recognize the CR 614.15 PARTIAL forms —
//! "… instead of <N>" / "… instead of <phrase>" — nor an override whose condition
//! failed to lower. Those lines fell through and were emitted as INDEPENDENT
//! top-level abilities, so the engine performed the base effect AND the override.
//!
//! Oracle text below is verbatim from the full-pool export (never a paraphrase):
//! a paraphrase can take a different parser branch and leave the real card broken.
