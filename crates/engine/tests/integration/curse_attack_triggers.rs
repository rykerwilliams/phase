//! Integration tests for curse cards with attack-related triggers.
//!
//! Covers 7 curses that trigger when creatures attack the enchanted player:
//!
//! Group A — "Whenever a player attacks enchanted player with one or more creatures":
//!   - Curse of Chaos (attacking player may discard → draw)
//!   - Curse of Inertia (attacking player may tap/untap target)
//!   - Curse of Shallow Graves (attacking player may create tapped 2/2 Zombie)
//!
//! Group B — "Whenever a creature attacks enchanted player":
//!   - Curse of Predation (put a +1/+1 counter on it)
//!   - Curse of the Forsaken (its controller gains 1 life)
//!   - Curse of Stalked Prey (combat damage → +1/+1 counter)
//!   - Curse of Hospitality (trample + combat damage → exile top)
//!
//! Each test verifies that the trigger fires when a creature attacks the
//! enchanted player. For Group A, the trigger fires once per attacking player.
//! For Group B, it fires once per attacking creature.
//!
//! NOTE: These tests depend on the `matching_attack_events` fix from PR #4401
//! which ensures "enchanted player is attacked" triggers fire correctly.
//!
//! CR references:
//!   - CR 303.4b: An Aura that enchants a player is attached to that player.
//!   - CR 508.1: Declare attackers step.
//!   - CR 508.3d: "Whenever [player] attacks" triggers fire once per attacked
//!     defending player, not once per creature.
