//! Fireball — runtime cost must scale with target count on the {X}+distribute
//! casting route.
//!
//! Real Oracle: "This spell costs {1} more to cast for each target beyond the
//! first. / Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any
//! number of targets."
//!
//! Fireball is the one real card combining an `{X}` cost + a Strive-shaped
//! per-target surcharge (CR 207.2c + CR 601.2f) + a distribute-among-targets
//! effect. Because its distribution defers target selection until AFTER `{X}`
//! is announced (CR 601.2b, gated by
//! `ability_utils::ability_distribution_pool_needs_chosen_x`), it commits its
//! division through `WaitingFor::DistributeAmong`. The pre-fix
//! `GameAction::DistributeAmong` mid-cast handler called
//! `casting_costs::finalize_cast` directly with `pending.cost` — the cost
//! locked in at `ChooseXValue` time (CR 601.2b), BEFORE targets were known — so
//! the per-target surcharge (CR 601.2f, computed by
//! `casting::apply_target_dependent_cost_modifiers`) was never applied: the
//! spell always cost as if it had a single target. The fix routes that handler
//! through `casting_costs::finish_pending_cast_cost_or_pay`, the same
//! post-target-selection cost authority every other casting route uses.
//!
//! FIXTURE NOTE (scope isolation): the surcharge is pinned directly with
//! `with_strive_cost` (CR 207.2c + CR 601.2f) rather than parsed from Oracle
//! text, exactly as this branch's plan directs (the runtime timing fix must not
//! depend on the separate parser fix, PR #5545). The card's effect text is the
//! VERBATIM distribution clause only ("Fireball deals X damage divided evenly,
//! rounded down, among any number of targets"), which is already parsed
//! correctly today and drives the real EvenSplitDamage distribute-among branch.
//! The printed surcharge line ("This spell costs {1} more to cast for each
//! target beyond the first") is deliberately EXCLUDED from the fixture text:
//! today's parser mis-lowers that "for each" clause into a self-spell cost
//! increase that evaluates to +{1} per battlefield permanent (the exact PR
//! #5545 defect), which would swamp this test with an unrelated, out-of-scope
//! cost inflation. Including it verbatim was verified to make the spell cost
//! `{X + battlefield-creature-count}{R}` — a parser bug this branch does not
//! own. Excluding one printed line while pinning its true effect keeps this
//! test focused strictly on the runtime distribute-route timing seam.
