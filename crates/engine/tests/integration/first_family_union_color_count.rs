//! First Family — "the number of colors among permanents you control **and**
//! spells you've cast this turn" is a SET UNION over two populations, resolved
//! through the real cast pipeline.
//!
//! Pre-fix, both quantity slots bound `QuantityRef::SpellsCastThisTurn` — a
//! COUNT OF SPELLS — silently dropping both the colour aggregation (CR 105.1)
//! and the "permanents you control" population, with no parse warning. Every
//! assertion below flips if that binding is restored:
//!
//!   * the self-inclusion case returns 1 (one cast record) instead of 2;
//!   * the disjoint case does not move when a permanent of a NEW colour is
//!     added, because the permanent population is not read at all;
//!   * a `Sum`-shaped implementation (`|A| + |B|`) over-counts the overlap,
//!     which is why the union must live inside the `HashSet` — `max`
//!     distributes over set union but a distinct-count does not.
