//! CR 702.68 — Frenzy N.
//!
//! "Frenzy N" means "Whenever this creature attacks and isn't blocked, it gets
//! +N/+0 until end of turn." (CR 702.68a). If a creature has multiple instances
//! of frenzy, each triggers separately (CR 702.68b).
//!
//! Before this change "Frenzy N" fell to `Keyword::Unknown` (a silent no-op) and
//! the Frenzy Sliver static grant ("All Sliver creatures have frenzy 1") fell to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented` because `parse_granted_keyword_fragment("frenzy 1")`
//! returned `None`. The fix adds the `Keyword::Frenzy(u32)` variant, the
//! parser/`FromStr` arms, and the synthesis builder
//! (`build_frenzy_trigger` → `TriggerMode::AttackerUnblocked` self-pump).
//!
//! These tests drive the REAL combat pipeline through `apply`:
//! declare-attackers (and, where relevant, declare-blockers) → the
//! `BlockersDeclared` event → the `AttackerUnblocked` trigger → stack →
//! resolution → layer system. They assert the *post-layer* `power`/`toughness`
//! of the attacker (the layer system writes effective P/T into
//! `obj.power`/`obj.toughness`), never the parsed `Pump` effect — so a missing
//! synthesized trigger fails the assertion.
