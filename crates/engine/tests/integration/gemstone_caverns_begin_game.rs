//! Regression for GitHub issue #431 — Gemstone Caverns' opening-hand ability
//! silently dropped part of its text.
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   "If this card is in your opening hand and you're not the starting player,
//!    you may begin the game with Gemstone Caverns on the battlefield with a
//!    luck counter on it. If you do, exile a card from your hand."
//!
//! The exported card data must retain the full `BeginGame` ability: Gemstone
//! Caverns enters with its luck counter, then its `IfYouDo` rider exiles a card
//! from its controller's hand.
//!
//! These tests drive the real begin-game / mulligan flow through `apply`:
//!   - accept the opt-in: Gemstone Caverns enters with a luck counter and an
//!     exile prompt is surfaced.
//!   - decline the opt-in: no exile prompt is surfaced (the `IfYouDo` gate
//!     evaluates false).
//!
//! No synthetic events — every step goes through `apply` / the public
//! game-start entry point.
