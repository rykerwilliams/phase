//! CR 506.3 + CR 508.1d + CR 611.2c: Gideon Jura's "+2: During target
//! opponent's next turn, creatures that player controls attack Gideon Jura if
//! able." — a forced-attack requirement whose required defender is a
//! PLANESWALKER rather than a player.
//!
//! These drive the real pipeline end-to-end: verbatim Oracle text → parser
//! (`Effect::ForceAttack { required_defender: SelfRef }`) →
//! `force_attack::resolve` (which snapshots the defender as
//! `RequiredDefender::Permanent` and installs ONE continuous effect carrying the
//! live affected filter) → `must_attack_defender_directives_for_creature` →
//! `attacker_constraints_for_active_player` (the DeclareAttackers payload
//! authority) AND the `declare_attackers` legality validator via the production
//! `GameAction::DeclareAttackers` route.
//!
//! The rulings these pin, verbatim from Gatherer:
//!   * "Gideon Jura's first ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. … This
//!     includes creatures that come under that player's control after the
//!     ability has resolved."
//!   * "If a creature controlled by the affected player can't attack Gideon Jura
//!     (because he's no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may
//!     have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all."
