//! Heart-Shaped Herb — the activated ability's trailing "and you become the
//! monarch" conjunct (CR 725.1) must actually grant the monarch at runtime.
//!
//! Oracle (verbatim, data/mtgjson/AtomicCards.json):
//!   If a source an opponent controls would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of
//!   that damage.
//!   {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You may sacrifice a creature. If you
//!   do, return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control with
//!   three +1/+1 counters on it and you become the monarch.
//!
//! The conjunct was dropped SILENTLY — the card reported as fully supported
//! with zero coverage gaps while never granting the monarch — because BOTH
//! seams it had to cross were broken:
//!   1. `strip_return_destination_ext_with_remainder` (lower.rs) truncated its
//!      remainder at the counter clause's START offset, discarding everything
//!      printed after it. It now CONSUMES the counter clause as a leading entry
//!      rider, so the remainder stays a true suffix.
//!   2. The chunk-level bare-and splitter `starts_bare_and_clause_lower`
//!      (sequence.rs) had no `"you become "` arm, so even an intact tail was
//!      not peeled into its own clause.
//!
//! Either fix alone leaves the card silent; the tests below pin the runtime
//! behavior that requires both.
//!
//! Every test here drives the real `apply()` pipeline (GameScenario +
//! GameRunner::activate + CR 602 announce/pay/resolve) and asserts measured
//! state deltas, never AST shape.
