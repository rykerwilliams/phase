//! Heroic Return / Recommission: a reflexive CR 608.2c "enters this way" rider
//! must not make the spell's reanimation line a CR 614.1c replacement.
//!
//! Before the fix, `is_replacement_pattern` scanned the WHOLE text unit for
//! CR 614.1c classifier tokens. Both cards supply "enters" and "counter"
//! entirely from their rider sentence, so Priority 8 claimed the line, the head
//! "Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield"

//! `Moved`/`Battlefield` replacement putting the +1/+1 counters on `SelfRef` —
//! the instant itself, which never enters the battlefield, so the effect was not
//! merely mislocated but unresolvable. `abilities` was empty.
//!
//! The fix head-scopes classification: a CR 608.2c back-reference to an earlier
//! instruction in the same ability contributes no CR 614.1c head tokens.
//!
//! Built via the `/card-test` recipe: `GameScenario` +
//! `GameRunner::cast(..).resolve()` + `CastOutcome` deltas, on verbatim Oracle
//! text from `data/card-data.json`. Every negative assertion is paired with a
//! positive reach-guard in the same test.
//!
//! REVERT DISCRIMINATOR: restore the whole-line token scan in
//! `oracle_classifier::is_replacement_pattern` and `heroic_return_reanimates_hero_with_two_extra_counters`
//! fails at its very first structural guard (`abilities` is empty again), while
//! `heroic_return_parses_to_reanimation_with_conditional_entry_counters` fails on
