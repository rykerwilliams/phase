//! Regression tests for Hunter's Insight — combat-damage → draw pipeline
//! (issue #391, follow-up to #384 / commit 6d18f5322).
//!
//! Hunter's Insight Oracle: "Choose target creature you control. Whenever that
//! creature deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker this turn, draw
//! that many cards."
//!
//! The card parses to an `Effect::TargetOnly` (target creature you control)
//! whose `SequentialSibling` sub-ability is an `Effect::CreateDelayedTrigger`.
//! The delayed trigger is a `WheneverEvent` over `DamageDone` (combat-only)
//! whose `valid_source` is `ParentTarget` (the chosen creature) and whose
//! `valid_target` is `Or[Player, Planeswalker]`. When the trigger fires it
//! draws `EventContextAmount` cards (the combat-damage amount) to the
//! controller. The draw is **mandatory** — the Oracle text has no "you may".
//!
//! These tests pin the #384 shape against regression:
//!   - Case A: targeted creature deals combat damage to a player → controller
//!     draws exactly that many cards.
//!   - Case B: parser-shape assertion — the delayed trigger's `valid_target`
//!     covers planeswalkers, `valid_source` is `ParentTarget`, `optional` is
//!     false. (The scenario harness has no planeswalker support, so the
//!     planeswalker branch is verified by shape, not runtime.)
//!   - Case C: a non-targeted decoy creature deals combat damage → no draw
//!     (the `ParentTarget` binding does not match the decoy), while the decoy
//!     still deals its combat damage (proving combat actually happened).
