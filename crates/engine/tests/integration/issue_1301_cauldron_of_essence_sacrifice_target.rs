//! Regression for issue #1301: activating Cauldron of Essence's
//! "{1}{B}{G}, {T}, Sacrifice a creature: Return target creature card from
//! your graveyard to the battlefield" ability let the engine auto-select the
//! permanent that was just sacrificed to pay the ability's own cost as the
//! return target.
//!
//! https://github.com/phase-rs/phase/issues/1301
//!
//! Per CR 601.2c / CR 602.2b, targets are chosen before costs are paid, so
//! the sacrificed creature was never in the graveyard at the moment legal
//! targets were determined. The card's own Oracle rulings confirm this
//! explicitly: "Because targets are chosen before costs are paid, the target
//! of Cauldron of Essence's last ability can't be the creature sacrificed to
//! pay its cost." The activation pipeline therefore determines legal graveyard
//! targets before paying the non-self sacrifice cost.
