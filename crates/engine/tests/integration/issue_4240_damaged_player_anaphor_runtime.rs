//! Runtime coverage for the PR #6540 parse-diff set (issue #4240).
//!
//! The parser fix that taught `parse_damage_source_subject` the article-less
//! Aura/Equipment determiners ("enchanted creature" / "equipped creature")
//! changed six cards' parse output. Two moved in the TARGET position
//! (Sigil of Sleep, Hammer of Ruin) and four in the QUANTITY position
//! (Quietus Spike, Scytheclaw, Sword of War and Peace, Sword of Fire and Ice
//! and War and Peace). Every one of them resolves the same anaphor: the
//! `"that player"` / `"their"` in the effect body is the player the equipped
//! or enchanted creature just damaged.
//!
//! CR 120.3a + CR 301.5a + CR 603.2: damage dealt to a player by the equipped
//! creature (CR 301.5a defines "equipped creature") identifies that player as
//! the triggering event's player (CR 603.2), so `"that player"` / `"their"`
//! binds to the DAMAGED player — never to the Equipment's controller.
//!
//! Every test is deliberately DISCRIMINATING: the two players are given
//! different life totals / hand sizes, so binding the anaphor to the
//! controller instead of the damaged player would produce a different,
//! asserted-against number. Sigil of Sleep's own regression lives in
//! `issue_4240_sigil_of_sleep_target_scope`.
//!
//! # The two classes of parse-diff change, and what these tests prove
//!
//! Running this module against the parser fix REVERTED separates them:
//!
//! * **Behavioral (regression tests — they FAIL when the fix is reverted).**
//!   `hammer_of_ruin_*` fails with `target_slots.len() == 2`: the pre-fix
//!   `ControllerRef::TargetPlayer` binding surfaces a phantom companion player
//!   slot, which is the softlock reported in issue #4240.
//!
//! * **Representation-only (invariance tests — they PASS either way).**
//!   `quietus_spike_*`, `scytheclaw_*` and `sword_of_war_and_peace_*` pass
//!   identically with and without the fix. During trigger resolution
//!   `QuantityContext::scoped_player` is already bound to the damaged player,
//!   so the pre-fix `PlayerScope::ScopedPlayer` and the post-fix
//!   `PlayerScope::Target` resolve to the SAME player. Their entries in the
//!   PR's `coverage-parse-diff` are therefore a change of representation with
//!   no change in behavior. These tests are kept precisely to pin that
//!   invariance: they are the evidence that the shared-grammar edit did not
//!   alter what these cards do.
