//! Regression for issue #5240: Silent-Blade Oni gives no prompt to choose or
//! cast a spell after dealing combat damage to a player.
//!
//! https://github.com/phase-rs/phase/issues/5240
//!
//! Oracle text (Scryfall-verified):
//!   Ninjutsu {4}{U}{B} ({4}{U}{B}, Return an unblocked attacker you control
//!   to hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and
//!   attacking.)
//!   Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, look at that
//!   player's hand. You may cast a spell from among those cards without
//!   paying its mana cost.
//!
//! Root cause: the trigger parses correctly into `RevealHand { target:
//! TriggeringPlayer, reveal: false }` (the private "look at that player's
//! hand" clause) followed by a `CastFromZone` sub-ability for "cast a spell
//! from among those cards ... without paying its mana cost." But
//! `try_parse_cast_effect`'s "from among them"/"from among those cards" arm
//! unconditionally bound the cast target to `TargetFilter::ExiledBySource` —
//! correct for the exile-then-cast class (Improvisation Capstone, Etali) this
//! anaphor was originally built for, but wrong here: Silent-Blade Oni never
//! exiles anything, so at runtime `ExiledBySource` resolves against an empty
//! tracked-exile set and the cast permission silently offers nothing — no
//! prompt is ever raised, matching the reported bug exactly.
//!
//! The fix threads a same-chain "prior RevealHand producer" signal
//! (`ParseContext::chain_prior_hand_reveal_target`, mirroring the existing
//! `chain_has_prior_exile_producer` precedent for the singular "the exiled
//! card" anaphor) so the plural anaphor binds to the REVEALED PLAYER'S HAND
//! instead when no exile occurred in the chain. The runtime hand-cast
//! resolver (`open_private_zone_cast_selection` in
//! `game/effects/cast_from_zone.rs`) previously also hardcoded the ability's
//! OWN controller as the hand to scan; it now resolves the candidate hand via
//! the cast filter's own `ControllerRef` (here `TriggeringPlayer`, the
//! damaged player) through the single `controller_ref_player` authority.
