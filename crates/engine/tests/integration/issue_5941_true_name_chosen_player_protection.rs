//! Issue #5941: True-Name Nemesis must not be targetable by objects controlled
//! by the player chosen as it entered the battlefield.
//!
//! The regression casts the parsed card through its as-enters replacement,
//! answers that production choice through `ChooseOption`, then checks the
//! production target-legality predicate with sources controlled by both players.
