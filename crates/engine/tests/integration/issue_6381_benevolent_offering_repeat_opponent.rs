//! Regression (issue #6381): Benevolent Offering's two independent "Choose an
//! opponent." instructions must each accept the SAME opponent in a two-player
//! game. Official ruling: "You may choose the same opponent for each of the
//! effects, or you may choose different opponents." (Confirmed identically
//! for the "Offering" cycle: Infernal/Intellectual/Sylvan Offering.)
//!
//! Before the fix, `ChoiceType::Opponent`/`ChoiceType::Player` unconditionally
//! excluded players already chosen earlier in the same resolution (correct
//! only for Gluntch, the Bestower's ordinal-cued "choose a second/third
//! player"). In a two-player game that made the SECOND "Choose an opponent."
//! impossible — CR 609.3 turned it into a no-op, so "that player" never got
//! bound for the life-gain clause and the chosen opponent gained 0 life
//! instead of 2 life per creature they control.
