//! GitHub issue #6858 — a chained "discard that many" that follows a draw
//! always resolved to 0.
//!
//! CR 608.2c + CR 121.2: `QuantityRef::PreviousEffectAmount { channel: Total }`
//! reads one resolution-local slot, `GameState::last_effect_amount`. Every
//! non-damage producer is contracted to stamp it (see the type doc on
//! `QuantityRef::PreviousEffectAmount`, which names "cards drawn" explicitly),
//! but `Effect::Draw` committed its instruction total only to
//! `state.last_effect_count`, so the chained consumer read `None` → 0 and the
//! discard silently short-circuited before `WaitingFor::DiscardChoice`.
//!
//! These tests pin the CHANNEL CONTRACT (`Draw` → `last_effect_amount`), not one
//! card: the first drives a synthetic "draw N, then discard that many" chain, the
//! second drives Varina, Lich Queen's real attack trigger end to end, and the
//! third pins the zero-draw case that keeps a preceding chain step's amount from
//! leaking into the discard count (Last Stand with no Islands).
