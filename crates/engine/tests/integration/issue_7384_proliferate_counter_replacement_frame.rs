//! Regression tests for GitHub issue #7384 — an orphaned `Proliferate` frame
//! poisons the resolution stack for the rest of the game.
//!
//! `WaitingFor::ProliferateChoice`'s handler used to call `apply_proliferate`
//! BEFORE taking the proliferate frame off the resolution stack, and to return
//! early when that call paused. `apply_proliferate` pauses whenever a
//! counter-placement replacement needs a CR 616.1 ordering choice (two
//! simultaneously-applicable `AddCounter` replacements — Hardened Scales plus
//! Doubling Season is the common pairing). The counter-additions drain that
//! resumes after the choice never popped the proliferate frame and never
//! resumed the proliferate, so:
//!
//!   * the `Proliferate` direct-choice frame stayed on the stack forever, and
//!     `ResolutionStack::validate` failed every LATER frame transition against
//!     it — the reported panic was a tutor (`SearchLibrary` + trailing
//!     `Shuffle`) parking its tail through `prepend_to_pending_continuation`,
//!     reporting `PromptMismatch { frame: Proliferate, waiting_for:
//!     "SearchChoice" }`;
//!   * every proliferate action after the first was silently skipped, so
//!     "proliferate twice" (Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus) performed once
//!     (CR 701.34a).
//!
//! The frame is now taken before any counter is applied, and the remaining
//! actions ride `PendingCounterPostAction::ContinueProliferateActions` on the
//! counter-additions completion.
