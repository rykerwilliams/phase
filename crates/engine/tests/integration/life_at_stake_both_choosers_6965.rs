//! Issue #6965 (follow-up): Life at Stake — *"You and target creature's
//! controller each secretly choose a number 0 or greater."*
//!
//! The compound subject's second conjunct TARGETS: it names a player through an
//! announced object. Unioning it into one subject filter would lose the target
//! binding, so the parser instead splits the shared predicate into two chained
//! halves and declares the announced creature with a slot-only
//! `Effect::TargetOnly` head (CR 115.1). The half for "you" is the unscoped
//! resolver default (CR 109.5); the half for "target creature's controller"
//! binds its acting player on the ABILITY via
//! `player_scope: ParentObjectTargetController` (CR 109.4), because
//! `Effect::Choose` carries no recipient field of its own.
//!
//! This test drives the REAL parse → cast → resolution pipeline and asserts the
//! only thing that matters at runtime: TWO number choices are raised, and the
//! second one prompts the TARGETED creature's controller, not the caster.
//!
//! Fail-on-revert: before the fix, the whole sentence lowered to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented { name: "unbound_subject" }` — no target slot, no
//! `NamedChoice` at all, so both assertions below fail.
//!
//! CR 109.4: only objects on the stack or battlefield have a controller — the
//! anchor "target creature's controller" reads.
//! CR 109.5: "you" on an object refers to that object's controller.
//! CR 115.1: targets are declared as the spell is put on the stack.
//! CR 601.2c: the caster announces a legal object for each target the spell
//! requires.
//! CR 608.2c: the controller follows the instructions in the order written.
//! CR 608.2d: a choice offered by a resolving spell is announced while applying
//! the effect.
