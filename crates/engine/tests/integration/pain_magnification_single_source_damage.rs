//! CR 603.2c + CR 120.4 + CR 120.4b: per-SOURCE damage aggregation — Pain
//! Magnification, "Whenever an opponent is dealt 3 or more damage by a single
//! source, that player discards a card."
//!
//! CR 603.2c is the operative rule for the two-attackers row: an ability
//! triggers once per occurrence of its trigger event, and "can trigger
//! repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences" — so one damage
//! event carrying two qualifying sources is two occurrences, not one summed
//! one. CR 120.4 names the whole-event default that the "…by a single source"
//! tail narrows away from: damage is processed in one four-part sequence over a
//! single damage event, and the worked example printed under CR 120.4d states a
//! multi-source event as one bracketed entry. CR 120.4b then puts damage
//! triggers at that granularity.
//!
//! The "…by a single source" tail narrows the threshold's aggregation domain
//! from the whole simultaneous damage event (the received-damage grammar's
//! default, CR 120.4 + CR 120.4b) to one source's share. So two attackers each
//! dealing 2 to the same player must NOT fire, even though the event total is
//! 4; and two attackers each dealing 3 must fire TWICE, once per qualifying
//! source. The card's own ruling states the per-source reading directly.
//!
//! These rows are the runtime carriers of the scope axis. Both are broken by
//! the same single mutation: make `parse_single_source_scope` emit
//! `WholeEvent` instead of `PerSource`, and the fold groups both damage events
//! under the single recipient P1 — 2 + 2 = 4 fires where 0 is correct, and
//! 3 + 3 = 6 collapses to one firing where 2 are correct.
