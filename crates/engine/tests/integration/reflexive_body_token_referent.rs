//! BB-FU9 — a clause whose subject is the token published by a clause under an
//! AFFIRMATIVE reflexive gate ("When you do, create a token. Put a +1/+1 counter
//! on that token.") binds that token, and is re-linked onto the gated
//! instruction's continuation path so the resolver's condition-false descent
//! cannot resolve it against a STALE entry of `state.last_created_token_ids` —
//! a game-lifetime ledger that is never cleared at a resolution boundary
//! (CR 603.12 + CR 608.2c + CR 609.3).
//!
//! Every row drives the REAL pipeline — `parse_oracle_text` /
//! `parse_effect_chain`, then `build_resolved_from_def_with_targets` +
//! `resolve_ability_chain` + `runner.act(DecideOptionalEffect)` — and asserts
//! RESOLVED board state. Four rows (T14, T15, T18, T19) are explicitly
//! AST-SHAPE rows: what they pin is that a `sub_link` does not LIE about which
//! instruction a clause belongs to, which is a parse-time property with no
//! behavioural twin (the condition-false descent resolves the clause either
//! way, from a different parent).
//!
//! **`engine::ai_support::legal_actions()` is never called here.** It simulates
//! every candidate action on a CLONE and silently swallows the mutation being
//! measured; this lane read a false 0 that way before.
//!
//! Synthetic Oracle text (T8, T12–T15, T17, T19, T20) is disclosed as such and
//! is templated verbatim from shipped patterns: "you may pay {N}. If you do,
//! create …" (Akoum Stonewaker, Krenko, Cadric) and "If you didn't create a
//! token this way, create …" (Springheart Nantuko). The two-publisher and
//! intervening-instruction shapes have no shipped witness, which is why they
//! are synthetic. Every shipped-card claim is asserted on the shipped card
//! (T1, T2, T3, T5, T6, T7, T9, T10, T11, T16, T18, T21), with Oracle text
//! byte-verbatim from MTGJSON `AtomicCards.json`.
