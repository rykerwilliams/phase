//! CR 115.7 — a parked retarget prompt must always be answerable.
//!
//! Three propositions, all reached through production entry points:
//!
//! 1. the retarget pool comes from the stack entry's OWN targeting authority,
//!    not from an Aura host's enchant filter (an Aura's triggered ability is a
//!    different object on the stack than the Aura spell — CR 115.1b + CR 113.7a,
//!    against the Aura SPELL's own rule, CR 303.4a);
//! 2. an empty pool resolves as a CR 115.7a no-change instead of parking a
//!    prompt nothing can discharge;
//! 3. every submission the AI proposes for a parked prompt is accepted by the
//!    reducer, because both consult the same per-slot authority
//!    (`retarget_slot_violation`).

///
///   * `expected` contains `[b, b]` and `[a, a]`. The generator substitutes one
///     slot at a time from the FLAT pool with no distinctness check, so a pool
///     member already held by another slot produces a duplicate. Whether a
///     duplicate is legal is a per-INSTANCE question (CR 601.2c: the same target
///     can't be chosen twice for any ONE instance of "target", but may be chosen
///     once for EACH instance if the spell uses "target" in several places), and
///     the flat pool carries no instance structure to answer it with. That is
///     the same pre-existing flat-pool gap `retarget_slot_violation`'s SCOPE
///     note records for `Attach` / `MoveCounters` / `Fight`. These two entries
///     are therefore recorded as OBSERVED CURRENT BEHAVIOUR, deliberately not
///     endorsed.
///   * The fixture is synthetic in the same direction: Lightning Bolt's "any
///     target" is ONE instance of "target", so a genuine Bolt cannot hold two
///     targets at all. The two-target list is fabricated to isolate enumeration,
///     which is why per-slot legality is out of this row's reach rather than

///     aren't changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed." Remedy
///     for a multi-target entry: ALL-OR-NONE, not one-changes-rest-stay. This is
///     Bolt Bend's wording — the WORDING only. Bolt Bend itself reads "with a
///     single target", and of the 22 printed cards matching
///     `o:"change the target of"`, the six omitting that literal phrase each
///     restrict to one target by the equivalent "targets ONLY <x>" / "a single
///     <x>" construction. No printed card on this template can therefore present
///     a multi-target entry, which is why the fixture below is synthetic.
///
/// Under neither remedy may an undisturbed slot simply be dropped. The length-1
/// acceptance is recorded here as OBSERVED CURRENT BEHAVIOUR, deliberately NOT
/// endorsed:
