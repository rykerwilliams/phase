//! DynQty subgroup C — "choose up to X, where X is the number of times you chose
//! a mode for that spell" (Riku of Many Paths) and the shared modal dynamic-cap
//! path (Bumi/Riku). Covers the three seams this change introduces:
//!
//!   1. STORAGE — `handle_select_modes` latches the chosen mode indices onto
//!      `SpellContext.chosen_modes`, and cast-finalize stamps them onto the
//!      spell-on-stack `GameObject.chosen_modes` (CR 700.2a + CR 700.2d).
//!   2. RESOLVER — `QuantityRef::EventContextSourceModesChosen` reads
//!      `chosen_modes.len()` off the `current_trigger_event` spell object
//!      (CR 700.2d + CR 601.2b).
//!   3. END-TO-END — Riku's triggered modal cap (`dynamic_max_choices`) resolves
//!      live to the number of modes chosen for the triggering spell, clamped to
//!      Riku's own mode_count (CR 700.2d), and surfaces as
//!      `AbilityModeChoice.modal.max_choices`.
//!
//! All Oracle text is verbatim engine-authoritative text (matches
//! `riku_modal_spell_trigger.rs` / `atarkas_command_*`).
