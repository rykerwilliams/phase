//! Regression: "if you can't, draw a card" — Roots of Wisdom
//! ("Mill three cards, then return a land card or Elf card from your graveyard
//! to your hand. If you can't, draw a card.").
//!
//! Bug: the trailing "If you can't, draw a card." sentence parsed as an
//! unconditional `Draw` sub-effect on the chain (`Draw { condition: null }`),
//! so the card ALWAYS drew a card after the return — even on the success
//! branch where a land/Elf was returned. That is a double-payoff.
//!
//! Fix (CR 608.2c): the "if you can't" condition parses as
//! `AbilityCondition::Not { ZoneChangedThisWay { filter: Any } }` and gates the
//! already-present `Draw` in place. `last_zone_changed_ids` is repopulated
//! per-effect, so after the return resolves it holds exactly the returned card
//! (or nothing). The `Draw` therefore fires iff the return moved nothing.
//!
//! Both tests cast the real card and drive the real resolution pipeline:
//!  - return a land  -> `ZoneChangedThisWay` true  -> `Draw` gated false -> 0
//!    cards drawn (the double-draw regression — the critical assertion);
//!  - return nothing -> `ZoneChangedThisWay` false -> `Draw` gated true  -> 1
//!    card drawn.

// so the "can't return — therefore draw" path cannot be reached by casting the
// real card (the engine has no castable empty-graveyard route for that Bounce).
// This test instead drives the real `resolve_ability_chain` pipeline — the
// exact code path the C1 condition lives on — with the same `Bounce -> Draw`
// chain Roots of Wisdom produces, gated by the C1 condition
// `Not { ZoneChangedThisWay { Any } }`. It exercises the per-effect
// `last_zone_changed_ids` repopulation and the condition evaluator, proving the
// gated `Draw` fires iff the preceding `Bounce` moved nothing. (`*_draws_zero`
// above covers the success branch end-to-end through a real cast.)
