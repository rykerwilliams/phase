//! Sauron, Dino Devotee (issue #7031) — runtime proof that a bullet-line
//! triggered-modal mode body's "It's a …" anaphor binds to the MODE'S OWN
//! TARGET (the creature that just received the saurian counter), never the
//! trigger source.
//!
//! Sauron's printed Oracle text (mode 2):
//!   "Turn People into Dinosaurs — Put a saurian counter on another target
//!    creature. It's a green Dinosaur with base power and toughness 5/5 for as
//!    long as it has a saurian counter on it."
//!
//! Regression mechanism (#6811 → #7031): the native-IR modal path threaded the
//! trigger context's `subject: Some(SelfRef)` into mode-body parsing without
//! the `derive_modal_subject` filtering the pre-IR path applied. The mode-body
//! "It's" then resolved to `SelfRef`, the contracted-copula honest-bind gate
//! declined to animate the trigger source, and the clause fell to
//! `Effect::Unimplemented` — no animation at runtime.
//!
//! CR 608.2c: instructions are followed in written order — the mode's own
//! earlier instruction ("Put a saurian counter on another target creature")
//! is the nearest antecedent for the mode-body "It".
//! CR 611.2b: "for as long as" durations — the effect ends when the condition
//! stops being true and does not resume.
//! CR 611.2c: the set of objects the continuous effect applies to is fixed
//! when the effect begins (the recipient is snapshotted).
//! CR 613.4b: base power/toughness setting applies in Layer 7b.
//! CR 122.1: counters placed by the resolving mode.
//! CR 700.2b + CR 603.3c: a mode with no legal targets cannot be chosen.
//!
//! Revert-fail (R1): with the mode-body subject filter reverted, mode 2's
//! second sentence is `Unimplemented`, so Foe Bear keeps (2,2) and the (5,5)
//! assertion fails.
