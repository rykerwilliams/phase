//! CR 608.2k + CR 303.4: an Aura token created "attached to it" by an ability
//! that chose no target must enchant the object its trigger condition named.
//!
//! The class is every `Effect::Token` whose `attach_to` is `ParentTarget` inside
//! an ability with no target slot. Measured over the shipped pool: 8 such token
//! specs on 6 cards (Faunsbane Troll, Cursed Courtier, Unassuming Sage, Twisted
//! Sewer-Witch, Asinine Antics, and Gylwain's three modes), against 5 cards whose
//! identical phrase sits behind a target and always worked (Monstrous Rage,
//! Croaking Curse, Royal Treatment, Return Triumphant, Not Dead After All).
//!
//! `ParentTarget` reads the first object in `ability.targets`, and these
//! abilities put none there: the host resolved to `None`, the Role entered
//! enchanting nothing, the CR 704.5m unattached-Aura state-based action moved it
//! to the graveyard, and CR 111.7 ended it there — all inside one resolution, so
//! the card looked like it did nothing at all.
//!
//! The rows are built from Oracle text rather than the card export so they run
//! in CI, where only the curated fixture exists; the two shipped cards are then
//! replayed end to end behind the fixture guard this suite uses elsewhere.
//!
//! The suite has since grown into the whole question the host resolver answers:
//! WHICH authority names a token's host. Beside the pronoun above it now covers
//! the context references that must never read the ability's chosen targets, and
//! the filters whose target slot holds a PLAYER rather than an object — the
//! class Selenia, the Cursed Heart prints (CR 115.1a + CR 303.4).
