//! Smaug the Impenetrable — passive-voice noncombat damage-received trigger.
//!
//! "Whenever Smaug is dealt noncombat damage, create that many Treasure tokens."
//! CR 120.2b classifies the damage as noncombat, CR 603.2c fixes how many times
//! the ability triggers (once per occurrence of its trigger event), and
//! CR 111.10a defines the Treasure tokens. Before the passive-voice damage
//! grammar was parameterized onto its axes, `"is dealt noncombat damage"` was an
//! unreachable cell — the eight enumerated `tag()` arms covered `"is dealt
//! damage"`, `"is dealt combat damage"` and the two excess forms, but never the
//! noncombat/total cell — so the trigger did not parse at all.
//!
//! Every test drives a REAL activated ability through the production pipeline
//! (`runner.activate(..).target_object(..).resolve()`), so the damage is a
//! genuine CR 120.2b noncombat `GameEvent::DamageDealt` raised by the
//! deal-damage resolver. Nothing is hand-injected. Reverting the parser change
//! leaves the trigger unparsed, so zero Treasures are created and the positive
//! assertions fail.
