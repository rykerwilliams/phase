//! Regression: Timely Ward — issue #329.
//!
//! CR 601.3d + CR 702.8a + CR 903.3: "You may cast this spell as though it had
//! flash if it targets a commander." The conditional flash permission must
//! gate the cast on the chosen target being a commander. Prior to this fix the
//! parser detected the `if`-clause via the `SwallowedClause / Condition_If`
//! detector but emitted the bare `AsThoughHadFlash` casting option without a
//! condition slot — letting the AI / player cast at instant speed against any
//! creature regardless of commander status.
