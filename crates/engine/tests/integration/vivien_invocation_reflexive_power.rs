//! Regression: Vivien's Invocation's reflexive-trigger damage must read the
//! ENTERING creature's power, not the spell's (which has none).
//!
//! Oracle: "Look at the top seven cards of your library. You may put a creature
//! card from among them onto the battlefield. ... When a creature is put onto
//! the battlefield this way, it deals damage equal to its power to target
//! creature an opponent controls."
//!
//! In "it deals damage equal to its power", "it"/"its" is the creature that was
//! just put onto the battlefield (CR 603.2 — the trigger's bound subject), NOT
//! the resolving spell and NOT the damage recipient. The amount must resolve to
//! the entering creature's power.
//!
//! This drives the PRODUCTION-parsed damage clause through the real damage
//! pipeline (`game/effects/deal_damage.rs` → `game/quantity.rs`
//! `resolve_object_pt`), in the reflexive-trigger context the card creates: the
//! resolving ability's source is the spell (a sorcery, no power); the trigger
//! event is the entering creature's zone change (CR 603.7c). The amount's
//! `QuantityRef::Power` scope decides the referent:
//!   - `ObjectScope::Source` → the spell → power 0 (WRONG: recipient takes 0).
//!   - `ObjectScope::Anaphoric` → the trigger-event source (the entering
//!     creature) → power 4 (CORRECT: recipient takes 4).
//!
//! The recipient (toughness 7) and the entering creature (power 4) are sized so
//! the assertion DISCRIMINATES the referent: 4 != 0 (no-effect / wrong Source
//! scope) and 4 != 7 (the recipient's own toughness / a target misread). The
//! amount used is read VERBATIM from the production parse, so reverting the
//! parser change (amount back to `Power{Source}`) flips the recipient's marked
//! damage from 4 to 0 and fails this test.
