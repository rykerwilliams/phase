//! Issue #6965: an unparseable subject must not become a board-wide effect.
//!
//! Two production-path regressions, one per half of the fix.
//!
//! **1. Fail closed.** Wand of Orcus — *"Whenever equipped creature attacks or
//! blocks, it and Zombies you control gain deathtouch until end of turn."* Both
//! subject-predicate sites that re-derive a subject used to substitute
//! `TargetFilter::Any` when the subject grammar returned `None`, and
//! `TargetFilter::Any` matches unconditionally (`game/filter.rs`). So the parse
//! FAILURE produced a BOARD-WIDE grant: every permanent the controller had —
//! lands and artifacts included — gained deathtouch. It now produces an honest
//! `Effect::Unimplemented` gap, and the runtime grants nothing.
//!
//! **2. Bind the compound subject.** Lazotep Plating — *"You and permanents you
//! control gain hexproof until end of turn."* This construction used to be
//! recognised by a single hardcoded literal arm matching exactly the phrase
//! `"you" + " and " + "permanents you control"`. It is now parsed by the general
//! CR 611.2c union arm, which parses each conjunct with the ordinary
//! single-subject grammar. This test is the regression guard for deleting the
//! literal arm: it fails if the generalization does not reproduce it.
//!
//! CR 611.2c: one continuous effect naming several subjects determines the set
//! each part applies to independently — i.e. the UNION of the named subjects.
//! CR 301.5a: an Equipment is attached to a creature, which is then the
//! "equipped creature". CR 301.5f: an ability referring to the "equipped
//! creature" means whatever creature the permanent is attached to.
//! CR 702.2b: deathtouch. CR 702.11b: hexproof.
