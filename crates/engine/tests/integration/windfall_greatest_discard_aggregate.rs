//! Windfall's cross-player MAX aggregate — "the greatest number of cards a

//!
//! Oracle (Scryfall, verified verbatim 2026-08-15):
//!   "Each player discards their hand, then draws cards equal to the greatest
//!    number of cards a player discarded this way."
//!
//! Class: Windfall, Jace's Archivist, Whispering Madness — identical text.
//!
//! CR 608.2e: the discard action is processed simultaneously for every player,
//!   then the draw action reads that completed action's result.
//! CR 608.2h: the draw count is determined ONCE, when the draw action is
//!   applied — not re-derived per player as the fan-out proceeds.
//! CR 608.2i: that determination is a look-back at the already-completed
//!   discard action, the exception to CR 608.2h this clause relies on.
//! CR 701.9a: to discard a card is to move it from hand to graveyard.
//! CR 121.2: drawing N cards is N individual card draws.
//!
//! The regression this pins: the engine reduces the per-player discard counts to
//! ONE untyped scalar whose aggregate lived on the PRODUCER. With the producer
//! set to a cross-player SUM, Windfall drew 8+7+3+3 = 21 for every player
//! instead of the greatest single player's 8.

/// applied-or-declined event resolve as it does. CR 608.2f: the discard action is taken on
/// four players and cannot be processed simultaneously once it pauses, so it is
/// processed per player — but it is still ONE action, and the look-back
/// (CR 608.2i) that feeds the draw clause must see every seat's contribution.
///
/// Discriminating: with `{P0:7, P1:3, P2:5, P3:2}` the correct MAX is 7, and 7
/// is unreachable under every partial-table failure mode — a table missing P0
/// yields 5, a table holding only the last resumed leg yields 2, and a table
/// where P0's paused card went uncounted yields 6.
///
/// Reach guards, both inside the asserted signature: `prompts == 7` proves the
/// pause path really ran seven times (a zero-prompt run would trivially satisfy
/// a graveyard check), and `graveyards == [8, 3, 5, 2]` proves all four seats
/// discarded their whole hands. P0's 8 is seven discards PLUS Windfall itself:
/// CR 608.2n — "As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell's resolution,
/// the spell is put into its owner's graveyard." That is the same reason the
