//! Shared helpers for walking an `AbilityDefinition`'s effect tree.
//!
//! `AbilityDefinition` composes a primary `effect` with an optional
//! `sub_ability` that itself has an `effect` plus another optional
//! `sub_ability`, forming a single-linked list. Feature detectors and
//! policies both need to classify the *set* of effects produced by an
//! ability (e.g., "does this ability both search the library and put a
//! land onto the battlefield?"), so they collect the chain into a flat
//! slice and iterate with `matches!`.
//!
//! Two branches of that definition are *conditional* rather than part of the
//! unconditional chain: `else_ability` (the CR 608.2c "Otherwise, ..." leg) and
//! `mode_abilities` (the CR 700.2 modal alternatives). Whether they belong in
//! the walk depends on the question being asked, which is what [`AbilityScope`]
//! names — see its docs. [`collect_scoped_effects`] is the single authority for
//! both walks; `collect_chain_effects` is the unconditional shorthand.
//!
//! Keep this module small — it is a single building block shared across
//! `features/*` and `policies/*`.

///   branch must not be credited to the cast.
/// * [`AbilityScope::Potential`] answers *"can this card ever produce effect
