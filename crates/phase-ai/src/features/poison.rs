//! Poison feature — structural detection of the alternate-win poison clock.
//!
//! Parser AST verification — VERIFIED against engine source:
//! - `Keyword::Toxic(u32)` at `crates/engine/src/types/keywords.rs:912`
//!   (CR 702.164: "Toxic N — when this creature deals combat damage to a
//!   player, that player gets N poison counters").
//! - `Keyword::Infect` at `crates/engine/src/types/keywords.rs:612`
//!   (CR 702.90: damage to players is dealt as poison counters).
//! - `Keyword::Poisonous(u32)` at `crates/engine/src/types/keywords.rs:898`
//!   (CR 702.70).
//! - `Effect::GivePlayerCounter { counter_kind, count, target }` at
//!   `crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs:12230`; `PlayerCounterKind::Poison` at
//!   `crates/engine/src/types/player.rs:56` (CR 122.1f). Note this effect scopes
//!   by `TargetFilter`, NOT by `CountScope` — the sibling `QuantityRef` arm at
//!   `ability.rs:5443` is a counter *reader*, not a granter.
//! - `Effect::Proliferate` / `Effect::ProliferateTarget { target }` at
//!   `crates/engine/src/types/ability.rs:10450` and `:10457` (CR 701.34a).
//!
//! No parser remediation required — every axis is expressible over existing
//! typed AST.
//!
//! ## Why this axis exists
//!
//! CR 104.3d makes ten poison counters a loss condition entirely independent of
//! life total, and `Player.poison_counters` is a dedicated engine field
//! (`crates/engine/src/types/player.rs:117`). The AI's evaluation is
//! life-total-centric, so a deck whose whole clock is poison reads as doing
//! nothing. This axis lets a policy see the second clock.
//!
//! ## Boundary with `plus_one_counters`
//!
//! `plus_one_counters` already counts `Effect::Proliferate` as a +1/+1 counter
//! enabler. That overlap is intentional and the axes stay independent: one
//! proliferate card genuinely serves both decks, and a Hardened Scales deck
//! scores high there while scoring ~0 here (no poison sources).
