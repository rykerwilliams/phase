//! `CostReductionPolicy` — makes a cost-reduction permanent a reason the AI can
//! see to deploy the discount BEFORE the spells it discounts.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! CR 601.2f: Goblin Electromancer, Baral, Foundry Inspector and the Medallion
//! cycle are acceleration that never taps for mana — every later spell costs
//! less for as long as the permanent survives. The engine already applies the
//! discount at cast time (`casting::collect_battlefield_cost_modifiers`), so the AI is never
//! overcharged; what it lacks is any reason to *sequence the reducer first*.
//! `RampTimingPolicy` supplies exactly that signal for permanents that add mana
//! (`Effect::Mana`, land fetch, extra land drops) and structurally cannot see a
//! cost reducer, so a deck whose entire acceleration plan is cost reduction gets
//! no sequencing guidance at all. This policy adds it.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! `verdict()` runs per candidate per search node. The card-local check — do
//! this candidate's OWN statics carry a board-wide reduction of your spells —
//! runs FIRST and rejects every non-reducer candidate after reading one card's
//! AST. Only a confirmed reducer pays for the hand walk, which is bounded by
//! hand size and touches no battlefield sweep, no `find_legal_targets`, and no
//! affordability query.
