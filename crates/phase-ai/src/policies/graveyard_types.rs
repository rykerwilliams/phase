//! `GraveyardTypesPolicy` — makes graveyard card-type diversity a resource the
//! AI can see (delirium / descend / threshold).
//!
//! ## The defect this closes
//!
//! CR 207.2c lists delirium, descend and threshold as **ability words** with no
//! rules meaning — the mechanical content is entirely the underlying "N or more
//! card types among cards in your graveyard" condition (CR 205.2a). 95 cards in
//! the corpus read that quantity, and nothing in the AI modelled the graveyard's
//! type spread. A self-mill that put the fourth distinct card type into the
//! graveyard — switching every delirium payoff on — scored exactly the same as
//! one that put in a redundant fifth creature.
//!
//! ## When the axis stops rewarding
//!
//! A *threshold* payoff (delirium, descend N) goes live at its threshold; once
//! the graveyard reaches it, more diversity buys nothing and the branch scores
//! zero — otherwise the AI would durdle with self-mill after delirium is on. A
//! *scaling* payoff (Consuming Blob) has no threshold and keeps
//! wanting a bigger, more diverse graveyard, so it is rewarded continuously
//! with a diminishing signal. A deck's threshold is modelled as `Option<u32>`
//! precisely so a scaling-only deck is never handed a fabricated four-type
//! ceiling. Same no-progress-no-score backbone as `PoisonClockPolicy`.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! `verdict()` runs per candidate per search node, so predicate order matters.
//! The card-local AST check (`fills_own_graveyard_parts`, over the action's
//! authoritative effect chain) runs FIRST and rejects the overwhelming majority
//! of candidates; only a confirmed graveyard-filler pays for the graveyard
//! scan. `GameState` carries no zone index, so that scan filters
//! `state.objects` (house practice) — but it never touches mana affordability
//! or `find_legal_targets`.
