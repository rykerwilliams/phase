//! CR 732.2a loop-shortcut proposal gate — decide whether the priority holder should
//! propose the auto-detected loop shortcut, or return to ordinary priority.
//!
//! ## The defect this closes
//!
//! At `WaitingFor::LoopShortcut` the candidate generator (`engine::ai_support::candidates`)
//! emits BOTH `GameAction::DeclareShortcut` (`TacticalClass::Utility`) and
//! `GameAction::DeclineShortcut` (`TacticalClass::Pass`) and explicitly defers the choice
//! "to the policy/search layer" — but no policy scored either action. `should_play_now_with_facts`
//! (`card_hints.rs`, terminal arm `_ => 0.5`) gives both 0.5, and the class-bonus table
//! (`planner/mod.rs`) then subtracts 0.1 (or 0.25) from `Pass` and nothing from `Utility`.
//! Result: the TACTICAL score preferred `Declare` (0.5) over `Decline` (0.4) in every game state.
//! On every path where the tactical score IS the whole score — the heuristic-only branch
//! (VeryEasy/Easy, `SearchConfig::default()`, ≥5p pods at `<= Medium`) and the deadline-expired
//! tactical floor (`search.rs:1956`) — that is the ENTIRE decision, so an AI holding priority on a
//! loop that a DIFFERENT player wins proposed the shortcut and handed that player the game. Under
//! search the final score is `cont + score * tactical_weight` (`search.rs:1990`), and there the
//! beam's continuation value could already prefer `Decline` on its own (measured control at Hard,
//! policy unregistered: Declare = -9999.925) — but nothing GUARANTEED it. The `Reject` makes the
//! refusal total on every path.
//!
//! ## Why a `TacticalPolicy` and not a picker special-case
//!
//! `PlannerServices::tactical_score` is the single scoring authority consulted by BOTH branches
//! of `score_candidates_core` — the search-ON ranked path and the heuristic-only path — plus the
//! beam interior node and the rollout leaf's priors. A `TacticalPolicy` is therefore
//! difficulty-independent BY CONSTRUCTION: it fires for VeryEasy / Easy (which force
//! `search.enabled = false`), for large pods at `<= Medium`, for the `SearchConfig::default()`
//! `enabled: false`, and for a pre-expired deadline — every path a picker special-case would
//! have to be duplicated into.
//!
//! Note the two branches weight this policy DIFFERENTLY. The search-ON branch multiplies the
//! tactical score by `tactical_weight` — `0.1` at a quiesced node, or `0.35` if an opponent's
//! object is on the stack (the offer is raised at a priority window, which does not imply an
//! empty stack); target-selection's `0.7` is unreachable here. The heuristic-only branch adds the
//! score RAW. So the positive win bonus is attenuated up to 10x under search — deliberately,
//! because there the beam's own continuation value already sees the crown. The REJECT is immune
//! to the weight AND the temperature: `-inf * 0.1 == -inf * 0.35 == -inf`, and `exp(-inf / T) == 0`
//! at every temperature, so no difficulty ever throws the game away.
//!
//! ## The three rulings the verdict encodes
//!
//! 1. `predicted_winner == Some(w), w != proposer` + `UntilLethal` ⇒ REJECT.
//!    `loop_check::live_mandatory_loop_winner` partitions the living players into `fallers`
//!    (per-cycle `delta.life < 0 || delta.poison > 0`) and `nonfallers`, and names a winner ONLY
//!    when `nonfallers.len() == 1`. The two sets partition `living`, so a named winner other than
//!    the proposer PROVES the proposer is a faller — a deterministic self-loss (CR 704.5a life /
//!    CR 704.5c poison) with the other player crowned by CR 104.2a. The declare is WEAKLY
//!    DOMINATED, not merely bad: the drive either reaches that crown, or aborts into
//!    `until_lethal_fallback`, which restores exactly the board a decline would have left.
//!    Loss-or-no-op — never a gain.
//! 2. `predicted_winner == None` + `UntilLethal` ⇒ REJECT.
//!    Only the object-growth offer carries `None`. The crown gate requires
//!    `Some(winner) == proposal.predicted_winner`, false for every winner when the latch is `None`
//!    ⇒ `until_lethal_fallback` full-rolls-back the board, clears `loop_detect_ring` +
//!    `last_recast_context`, and hands priority back. Zero progress, the CR 732.2b APNAP window
//!    burned, the re-offer signal destroyed — weakly dominated by declining.
//! 3. `predicted_winner == Some(proposer)` + `UntilLethal` ⇒ positive (critical band).
//!    The crown IS the win (CR 104.2a); the only other outcome is `until_lethal_fallback`, which
//!    lands where declining lands. Dominant in outcome. (It is not costless: declaring opens the
//!    CR 732.2b window, and an opponent's `Shorten` hands THEM a priority window they would not
//!    get if the AI declined and kept priority. The crown is worth that risk; the phrase "no
//!    downside" would not be true.)
//!
//! ## Why the `IterationCount` gate is load-bearing for the CLASS
//!
//! `materialize_fixed_shortcut` NEVER consults `predicted_winner`: it drives `n` whole cycles and
//! COMMITS each atomically (an object-growth `None` offer is routed to
//! `materialize_object_growth_shortcut`). A `Fixed(n)` declare is real, committed board progress
//! needing no crown — so a reject that ignored the count would be wrong for the class. Today's AI
//! candidate generator only ever emits `UntilLethal`, but `Fixed(n)` is reachable through the
//! public `GameAction` surface: `handle_declare_shortcut` moves `count` into the proposal with
//! ZERO validation (the fail-closed firewall validates only `template` pins, and it runs against
//! the RESOLVED template rather than the payload's: the handler shadows it with
//! `template.or_else(|| offer.declaration.cloned())` before the `match`, so a payload carrying
//! `None` against an offer that PUBLISHED a declaration reaches the `Some` arm and IS
//! pin-validated by `declaration_conforms`. The firewall is skipped only when the payload carried
//! none AND the offer published none — the arm that still refuses unless the proposer controls
//! the recorded loop period).
//!
//! ## Why the verdict reads `proposer` from the state, never `ctx.ai_player`
//!
//! `WaitingFor::acting_player()` returns `Some(proposer)` for `LoopShortcut`, and the beam/rollout
//! paths bind `PolicyContext::ai_player` to exactly that, so the two coincide wherever both are
//! defined. Reading `proposer` is fail-safe: the candidate is the proposer's action by
//! construction (`metadata.actor == Some(proposer)`), so the veto stays correct even if a caller
//! ever scores this state under a different seat's value lens — whereas gating on
//! `ctx.ai_player == proposer` would silently DROP the veto in that case.

/// winning line (self-mill payoffs; `loop_check` classifies such a period as `Advantage`, and
/// `elimination_bounds` intentionally permits the exactly-zero terminal value), so vetoing it
/// would refuse a real strategy class. A certified period records per-cycle resource deltas; it
/// cannot express "and then the proposer is forced to draw", so on today's evidence no
/// library-based veto is sound. **Extension point:** if a future certificate can prove a forced
/// post-zero draw, that is what would license adding the axis back — reconcile it against
/// `loop_shortcut_declare_that_mills_the_proposer_to_exactly_zero_still_scores`.
///
/// **The principle is accumulation ≠ realization, and the engine already tests it.** The One Ring
/// under the Kilo/Freed/Relic proliferate engine certifies an infinite burden-GROWTH loop as
/// `WinKind::Advantage` — not a win — naming the unbounded burden counter axis
/// (`analysis/corpus_tests.rs`, `one_ring_burden_growth_certificate`, with the 0-burden dead-loop
/// control beside it and the driver doc at `analysis/corpus.rs`). The burden's lethality realizes
/// only DOWNSTREAM, at the upkeep trigger, which is where CR 704.5a finally applies:
/// `tests/integration/one_ring_burden_upkeep_lethal.rs` pairs
/// `one_ring_burden_upkeep_kills_owner_p0_wins` with the sub-lethal control
/// `one_ring_sublethal_burden_owner_survives_no_gameover`. The engine therefore refuses to treat
/// in-loop accumulation of a doom resource as realized elimination. An emptying library is the
/// same shape with mill in place of burden and the draw attempt in place of the upkeep trigger,
/// so excluding it makes this policy consistent with the engine's own tested doctrine rather than
/// stricter than it.
///
/// **That is also why life STAYS, and the line is principled rather than an ad-hoc keep/drop.**
/// `per_cycle.delta.life` is IN-CYCLE realization: the drain happens inside the certified period
/// and is state-based-checkable at cycle boundaries, so the certificate does prove the death it
/// implies. The One Ring's life loss would only enter a certificate the same way if the upkeep
/// trigger were inside the loop span. Both surviving axes are immediate state-based losses on
/// state alone (CR 704), requiring no intervening action — which is exactly the property an empty
/// library lacks.
///
/// Only movement TOWARD death counts: a life gain or a poison decrease yields no bound on that
/// axis, which is why each rate is tested `> 0` before it is allowed to divide.
///
/// Returns the MINIMUM across axes, so the caller compares one number against the declared
/// count. `None` means "no axis kills the proposer at any n" — including the case where this
/// offer carries no certified period at all. That last branch is unreachable for the bounded

/// the reach-guards in `loop_shortcut_declare_that_kills_the_proposer_on_life_is_refused` and
