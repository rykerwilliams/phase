//! `PoisonClockPolicy` — makes the CR 104.3d poison clock visible to an AI
//! whose evaluation is otherwise life-total-centric.
//!
//! ## The defect this closes
//!
//! CR 104.3d: "If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses
//! the game the next time a player would receive priority." That is a win
//! condition entirely independent of life total, tracked in a dedicated engine
//! field (`Player.poison_counters`). Nothing in the AI scored progress along
//! it, so an infect/toxic deck's whole plan registered as doing nothing: a
//! proliferate that takes an opponent from 9 to 10 poison scored the same as
//! one that took them from 0 to 1.
//!
//! ## Rules-correctness note that drives the branch structure
//!
//! CR 701.34a defines proliferate over "permanents and/or players that **have
//! a counter**". Proliferating when no opponent is poisoned adds nothing on
//! this axis — so that branch scores zero rather than a nudge. Getting this
//! backwards would push the AI to durdle with proliferate before the clock has
//! started.
//!
//! ## Where each branch is scored
//!
//! The clock advances through three distinct decisions, and each is scored at
//! the seam where it is actually decided:
//!
//! | Decision | Seam | Rule |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | direct poison / proliferate | `CastSpell` · `ActivateAbility` | CR 122.1f · CR 701.34a |
//! | a modal card's poison mode | `SelectModes` | CR 601.2b |
//! | attacking with a poison source | `DeclareAttackers` | CR 702.90b · 702.164c · 702.70a |
//!
//! CR 601.2b makes mode selection a step of *announcing* a spell, so a
//! `CastSpell` candidate has no chosen mode yet and must not be credited with
//! a mode's poison. The unconditional-vs-modal split is expressed once, in
//! [`crate::ability_chain::AbilityScope`], and shared with deck-time detection.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! `verdict()` runs per candidate per search node. Every predicate here is
//! card-local (`obj.abilities` / `obj.keywords`) or a plain `u32` field read on
//! `Player.poison_counters`; the combat branch is linear in the candidate's own
//! attack list. No board-wide sweep, no affordability call, no
//! `find_legal_targets` — nothing this policy touches is on the documented
//! inner-loop landmine list.
