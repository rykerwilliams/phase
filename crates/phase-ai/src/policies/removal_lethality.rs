//! Removal-lethality assessment — makes a direct-damage removal spell prefer a
//! target its damage can actually KILL over the biggest body on the board.
//!
//! ## The defect this closes (#6582)
//!
//! [`EvasionRemovalPriorityPolicy`](super::evasion_removal_priority) ranks
//! removal targets by threat value, so it points a fixed-damage burn spell at
//! the biggest creature — a 7/7 — even when the spell deals 3 and cannot
//! destroy it, wasting the card. The AI modelled no lethality at all, so
//! "kills it" and "tickles it" scored the same and the biggest threat always
//! won.
//!
//! ## Model the engine's damage RESULTS, not a damage integer
//!
//! Whether damage kills depends on the damage SOURCE, not only on the amount
//! (CR 120.3), so collapsing a spell's damage into one number gets three whole
//! classes of removal wrong:
//!
//! * CR 120.3d + CR 702.80a: a source with wither/infect marks no damage at
//!   all — it puts that many -1/-1 counters on the creature, which lower its
//!   toughness (CR 122.1a). Reaching 0 toughness is CR 704.5f (put into the
//!   graveyard), which is *not* a destruction, so indestructible (CR 702.12b)
//!   does not save the creature.
//! * CR 702.2b + CR 704.5h: a source with deathtouch makes *any* marked damage
//!   lethal, however large the body.
//! * CR 120.3: for `DamageSource::Target` the first object target IS the source
//!   and is excluded from the recipients, so the object being scored may not be
//!   a recipient at all.
//!
//! The pending spell's damage is therefore reduced to a typed [`DamageOutcome`]
//! (marked damage + -1/-1 counters + deathtouch) resolved per damage source,
//! and only then judged against the target in [`outcome_is_lethal`], which
//! mirrors the state-based-action precedence in `engine::game::sba`. Where the
//! source is not knowable while a target is still being chosen, the term
//! reports [`PendingDamage::Unresolved`] and the policy stays neutral rather
//! than scoring a guess.
//!
//! ## Building block, not a card fix
//!
//! These are pure functions over the pending spell's own damage effects and the
//! target's runtime state — a reusable primitive any removal-targeting policy
//! can consult, covering every direct-damage removal spell rather than one
//! card. The term is inert (`0.0`) whenever the pending effect deals no
//! modelled damage to the target, so `-X/-X`, destroy, and exile removal are
//! untouched.
