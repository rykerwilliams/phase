# Diff-based gate: test code must not load the full ~90 MB card-data export
# (client/public/card-data.json) directly.
#
# Under `cargo nextest` every test runs in its own process, so a per-test
# `CardDatabase::from_export(client/public/card-data.json)` reparses the whole
# ~90 MB / 35k-card export — tens of seconds PER TEST in a debug build. Worse,
# the export is gitignored and absent in the CI `Rust tests` job, so those tests
# silently self-skip there: they are invisible in CI yet bloat every local and
# Tilt `test-engine` run.
#
# Use the fixture-backed loaders in tests/integration/support.rs instead:
#   shared_card_db()          -> parsed CardDatabase from the committed fixture
#                                (tests/fixtures/integration_cards.json.gz),
#                                parses in milliseconds and runs in CI.
#   shared_card_export_json() -> raw JSON of the full export, ONLY for the few
#                                drift-guard tests that must scan every card.
# Need a card the fixture lacks? Add it with `python3 scripts/gen-test-fixture.py`.
#
# Existing offenders are frozen in amber — this check flags only *newly added*
# offending lines in the diff (same mechanism as check-parser-combinators.sh and
# check-engine-authorities.sh), so it can land before the back-catalogue is
# migrated.
#
# Exempt: a flagged line (or the line immediately above it) carrying
#     // allow-full-card-db: <reason>
# Allowed files (legitimately reference the full-export path): see ALLOWED_FILES.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-test-card-data-load.sh [base-ref]

# Default base-ref is the merge-base with origin/main. In CI, pass the PR target

ERROR: New test code loads the full card-data export (client/public/card-data.json).

Under nextest (process-per-test) this reparses ~90 MB per test — tens of seconds
each in debug — and the export is gitignored, so the test silently self-skips in
CI while bloating every local and Tilt test run.

Use the fixture-backed loaders in crates/engine/tests/integration/support.rs:
    CardDatabase::from_export(".../client/public/card-data.json")
                                  ->  support::shared_card_db()          (fixture)
    (a test that must scan EVERY card)
                                  ->  support::shared_card_export_json()  (raw JSON)
Add any card the fixture lacks with: python3 scripts/gen-test-fixture.py

Forbidden in added lines (diff vs ${BASE}):
${report}

If a test genuinely must load the full export (e.g. an all-cards drift guard
that cannot use shared_card_export_json), annotate the line with:

    // allow-full-card-db: <one-line reason>

    exit 1
