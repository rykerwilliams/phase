# phase.rs onboarding bootstrap.
#
# Two axes:
#
#   Mode axis — what gets fetched/built:
#     * Full mode (default): everything an interactive human dev needs to run
#       the app in a browser, including the three Scryfall image/printing
#       sidecars consumed at runtime by the React frontend for card art.
#     * Agent mode (--agent, env PHASE_SETUP_AGENT=1): skips the Scryfall
#       sidecars. They are runtime-only image data — no Rust or frontend test
#       depends on them (the one vitest test that names them mocks `fetch`).
#       Use this for LLM-driven contributors running the docs/AI-CONTRIBUTOR.md
#       developer track — saves a multi-hundred-MB Scryfall bulk download with
#       zero impact on cargo / clippy / test / gen-card-data / coverage signal.
#
#   Build axis — whether to eagerly build WASM + card-data:
#     * Tilt mode (default when `tilt` is on PATH): skips the eager builds
#       because `tilt up` rebuilds both via the `wasm` and `card-data`
#       resources on first start. Avoids fighting Tilt for the cargo target
#       lock the moment the user starts the dev loop.
#     * Manual mode (--no-tilt or PHASE_SETUP_NO_TILT=1, or simply no `tilt`
#       on PATH): runs `build-wasm.sh` + `gen-card-data.sh` inline so the repo
#       is test-ready without Tilt.
#
# Caddy/SSL is intentionally NOT invoked — it's only needed for LAN HTTPS
# (WebRTC P2P guesting) and is gated behind `tilt up -- https`. See
# scripts/setup-ssl.sh + Caddyfile if you want it.
